By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers’ acceptances during the period May 23 through June 19, 1967, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The economic and financial developments reviewed at this meeting suggest that economic activity is rising modestly, and that prospects for economic expansion later in the year have strengthened. Output is still being retarded by adjustments of excessive inventories, but growth in final demands continues strong, reflecting substantial further increases in Government expenditures and also some strengthening of consumer buying. Prices of farm products have turned up recently, but average prices of industrial commodities have remained stable. The pace of bank credit expansion has increased in recent weeks, but is still well below the rapid rate of earlier in the year. Most long-term interest rates have tended to rise further under the influence of heavy securities market financing, and most short-term yields have also increased. The balance of payments deficit has remained substantial despite some improvement in the foreign trade",,
19670620,"6/20/67 4+  surplus. In this situation, it is the Federal Open Market Committee's policy to foster money and credit conditions, including bank credit growth, conducive to renewed economic expansion, while recognizing the need for progress toward reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of expected Treasury financing activity, the timing and quantity of which are still uncertain, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining about the same conditions in the money market as have prevailed since the preceding meeting of the Committee, while continuing to utilize operations in coupon issues in supplying part of reserve needs.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Open Market Committee's rules regarding the availability of information were revised effective July 4, 1967, to read as follows:  RULES REGARDING AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION SECTION 271.1--BASIS AND SCOPE  This Part is issued by the Federal Open Market Committee (the ""Committee'') pursuant to the requirement of section 552 of Title 5 of the United States Code that every agency shall publish in the Federal Register for the guidance of the public descriptions of the established places at which, the officers from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests or obtain decisions,  SECTION 271.2--DEFINITIONS  (a) “Information of the Committee''. - For purposes of this Part, the term “information of the Committee"" means all information coming into the possession of the Committee or of any member thereof or of any officer, employee, or agent of the Committee, the Board of Governors",,

19670620,"6/20/67 -6 (c) Other published information. - From time to time,  other information relating to open market operations of the Federal Reserve Banks is published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, issued monthly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in such Board's annual report to Congress, and in announcements and statements released to the press. Copies of issues of the Bulletin and of annual reports of the Board may be obtained upon request.  SECTION 271.4--RECORDS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC  ON REQUEST (a) Records available, - Records of the Committee  are made available to any person, upon request, for inspection or copying in accordance with the provisions of this section and subject to the limitations stated in sections 271.5 and 271.6 of this Part.

(b) Place and time. - In general, the records of the Committee are held in the custody of the Board of Governors of the federal Reserve System, but certain of such records, or copies thereof, are held in the custody of one or more of the Federal Reserve Banks. Any such records subject to this section will be made available for inspection or copying during regular business hours at the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in the Federal Reserve Building, 20th and Constitution Avenue, Washington, D.

SECTION 271.5--DEFERMENT OF AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN INFORMATION  (a) Deferred availability of information. In some instances, certain types of information of the  Committee are not published in the Federal Register  or made available for public inspection or copying until after such period of time as the Committee may determine to be reasonably necessary to avoid the effects described in paragraph (b) of this section or as may otherwise be necessary to prevent impairment  of the effective discharge of the Committee's statutory responsibilities.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, November 14, 1967, at 9:30 a.m.  By unanimous vote, the recommendation of the Steering Committee for the U.S. Government Securities Market Study, that daily reports of individual Government securities dealers regarding their positions, trading, and borrowings be made available to senior personnel at the Trading Desk of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was approved.  Secretary's note: On November 3, 1967  the following letter was sent to Government securities dealers over the signatures of Secretary Fowler and Chairman Martin:  In January 1960 the then Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System wrote the Government securities dealers requesting their cooperation in an information program covering the Government securities market. The program provided for the collection, by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, of dealer figures on positions, volume and borrowings with appropriate safeguards to assure the confidentiality of individual dealer information.  In this connection Mr, Alfred Hayes, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, wrote the dealers on",,
19671024,"10/24/67 -5 May 17, 1960 to the effect that the dealer data would be collected and retained in the Market Statistics Department of that bank and that data on individual firms would be released outside the Department only under certain conditions which included the following:  1. Summary figures requested by the Manager of the System Open Market Account for individual dealers seeking repurchase accommodation;  2. individual dealer reports requested by the Manager of the Open Market Account in market situations determined to be disorderly; and  3. other circumstances of an exceptional nature.  Under these arrangements the Manager of the System Open Market Account and his assistants have had access to the individual dealer data only on a few unusual occasions, whereas prior to 1960 dealers had reported directly each day to the Desk. With the passage of time it has become apparent that the quality of information available to the Trading Desk for interpreting the state of the market has deteriorated considerably because of the lack of access to these figures. Given the Trading Desk's responsibilities as the eyes and ears of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve in the market, the importance of full information should be obvious to all market participants. The current joint Treasury-Federal Reserve study of the Government securities market confirms the Manager's need for more detailed information on dealer market activities.  Accordingly, the Federal Open Market Committee and the Treasury have approved the release of the daily reports of the individual dealers on positions, volume and borrowings to the Manager of the System Open Market Account, and to a restricted list of officers and senior staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York directly responsible to the Manager. We understand that Mr, Alan Holmes has discussed the proposed policy change with all dealer firms, and that while some dealers have reservations about the change in procedure, none of these is of a nature that would cause any firm to object to the change.",,
19671024,"10/24/67 -6 We stress again that the purpose of the change is to provide more accurate information about the state of the market. No change in the data to be submitted by your firm to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is involved nor is there any change in the procedures currently in effect with respect to the supply and publication of data. These data will not be used in connection with particular transactions to be carried out in the market with individual dealer firms, apart from exceptional market circumstances of the sort where the existing rules already provide for the release of individual dealer figures outside the Market Statistics Department. The Treasury and the Federal Reserve stand ready to discuss any aspect of the statistical program with any dealer firm at any time.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary",,

19671212,"12/12/67 -4 The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that industrial output and employment have rebounded following strike settlements in the automobile and other industries, and that prospects have heightened for more rapid expansion of over-all economic activity in the months ahead. Both industrial and consumer prices have continued to rise at a substantial rate. The imbalance in U.S. international transactions has worsened, partly because of weakening in the export surplus since midyear. Foreign purchases of gold have been large following the devaluation of the pound sterling. Bank credit expansion has lessened, with diminished bank buying of Government securities and continued moderate loan growth. Most interest rates have risen further in reaction to the British devaluation and Bank rate increase, the rise in Federal Reserve discount rates, and waning expectations o£ enactment of the President's fiscal program, In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resistance of inflationary pressures and progress toward reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to moving slightly beyond the firmer conditions that have developed in money markets partly as a result of the increase in Federal Reserve discount rates; provided, however, that operations shall be modified as needed to moderate any apparently significant deviations of bank credit from current expectations or any unusual liquidity pressures.

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that over-all economic activity has been expanding vigorously, with both industrial and consumer prices continuing to rise at a substantial rate, and that prospects are for further rapid growth and persisting inflationary pressures in the period ahead. The imbalance in U.S. international transactions worsened further in late 1967, but the new program announced by the President should result in a considerable reduction in the deficit this year. Following announcement of the program, foreign purchases of gold slackened abruptly and the dollar strengthened in foreign exchange markets. Long-term bond yields have declined in recent weeks but some short-term interest rates have risen further. Bank credit has changed little on balance recently as banks have disposed of Government securities to accommodate strengthened loan demands. Growth in the money supply has sLackened and flows into time and savings accounts at bank and nonbank financial intermediaries have continued to moderate. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resistance of inflationary pressures and progress toward reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the somewhat firmer conditions that have developed in the money market in recent weeks, partly as a result of the increase in reserve requirements announced to become effective in mid-January; provided, however, that operations shall be modified as needed to moderate any apparently significant deviations of bank credit from current expectations.",,

The imbalance in U.S. international transactions worsened further in late 1967, primarily because of a sharp reduction in the surplus on merchandise trade. Although day-to-day money market rates have remained firm, rates on other short-term instruments have declined recently; meanwhile, long-term bond yields have fluctuated irregularly below the peaks reached late last year. Growth in bank credit resumed in January, reflecting both loan expansion around the year end and Treasury financing. The money supply expanded sharply following earlier slackening, but flows into time and savings accounts at bank and nonbank financial intermediaries have continued to moderate.

(1) Whenever it deems it necessary in the light of economic conditions and the general credit situation then prevailing (after taking into account the possibility of providing necessary credit through advances secured by direct obligations of the United States under the last paragraph of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act), such Federal Reserve Bank may purchase and sell obligations",,
19680305,"3/5/68 -9 of the United States for its own account, either outright or under repurchase agreement, from and to banks, dealers, or other holders of such obligations.

(3) Such Federal Reserve Bank may in its discretion purchase special certificates of indebtedness directly from the United States in such amounts as may be needed to cover overdrafts in the general account of the Treasurer of the United States on the books of such Bank or for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, but such Bank shall take all steps practicable at the time to insure as far as possible that the amount of obligations acquired directly from the United States and held by it, together with the amount of such obligations so acquired and held by all other Federal Reserve Banks, does not exceed $5 billion at any one time.

It shall be the practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as practicable, considering needs for minimum working balances, Such investments shall be in accordance with Section 14(e) of the Federal Reserve Act.  6. A Subcommittee consisting of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Committee and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors (or in the absence of the Chairman or of the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors the members of the Board designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee his alternate) is authorized to act on behalf of the Committee when it is necessary to enable the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to engage in foreign currency operations before the Committee can be consulted. Ail actions taken by the Subcommittee under this paragraph shall be reported promptly to the Committee.  7. The Chairman (and in his absence the Vice Chairman of the Committee, and in the absence of both, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors) is authorized:  A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Secretary;",,
19680305,"3/5/68 -16 B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on such policy matters as may relate to the Secretary's responsibilities; and  C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.  8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.  9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3 G (1) of the Board of Governors’ Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.  10. The Special Manager of the System Open Market Account for foreign currency operations shall keep the Committee informed on conditions in foreign exchange markets and on transactions he has made and shall render such reports as the Committee may specify.  By unanimous vote, the foreign currency directive given below was reaffirmed: FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE  i. The basic purposes of System operations in foreign currencies are:  A. To help safeguard the value of the dollar in international exchange markets;  B. To aid in making the system of international payments more efficient ;  C. To further monetary cooperation with central banks of other countries having convertible currencies, with the International Monetary Fund, and with other international payments institutions;",,
19680305,"3/5/68 -i7 BD. To help insure that market movements in exchange rates, within the limits stated in the International Monetary Fund Agreement or established by central bank practices, reflect the interaction of underlying economic forces and thus serve as efficient guides to current financial decisions, private and public; and  E. To facilitate growth in international liquidity in accordance with the needs of an expanding world economy.  2. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee, System operations in foreign currencies shall be undertaken only when necessary:  A. To cushion or moderate fluctuations in the flows of international payments, if such fluctuations (1) are deemed to reflect transitional market unsettlement or other temporary forces and therefore are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future; and (2) are deemed to be dis-equilibrating or otherwise to have potentially destabilizing effects on U.S. or foreign official reserves or on exchange markets, for example, by occasioning market anxieties, undesirable speculative activity, or excessive leads and lags in international payments;  B. To temper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates, and to moderate forward premiums and discounts judged to be dis-equilibrating. Whenever supply or demand persists in influencing exchange rates in one direction, System transactions should be modified or curtailed unless upon review and reassessment of the situation the Committee directs otherwise;  C. To aid in avoiding disorderly conditions in exchange markets. Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions, Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Special Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to reestablish",,
19680305,"3/5/68 -18 supply and demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments. In such cases, the Special Manager shall consult as soon  as practicable with the Committee or, in an emergency, with the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for System foreign currency operations; and  DB. To adjust System balances within the limits established in the Authorization for System foreign currency operations in light of probable future needs for currencies.  3. System drawings under the swap arrangements are appropriate when necessary to obtain foreign currencies for the purposes stated in paragraph 2 above.  4. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, transactions in forward exchange, either outright or in conjunction with spot transactions, may be undertaken only (i) to prevent forward premiums or discounts from giving rise to dis-equilibrating movements of short-term funds; (ii) to minimize speculative disturbances; (iii) to supplement existing market supplies of forward cover, directly or indirectly, as a means of encouraging the retention or accumulation of dollar holdings by private foreign holders; (iv) to allow greater flexibility in covering System or Treasury commitments, including commitments under swap arrangements; (v) to facilitate the use of one currency for the settlement of System or Treasury commitments denominated in other currencies; and (vi) to provide cover for System holdings of foreign currencies,  By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 6 through March 4, 1968, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  Renewal for a further period of three months of the $100 million swap arrangement with the Bank of France, maturing on  March 29, 1968, was approved.",,
19680305,"3/5/68 -19 By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period February 6 through March 4, 1968, were approved, ratified, and confirmed,  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that over-all economic activity has been expanding rapidly, with both industrial and consumer prices rising at a substantial rate, and that prospects are for continuing rapid growth and persisting inflationary pressures in the period ahead. The foreign trade surplus has been at a sharply reduced level in recent months and the imbalance in U.S. international payments remains serious. Interest rates on most types of market instruments have edged up recently, following earlier declines. While growth in bank credit has moderated on balance during the past three months, bank credit expansion has been substantial in February, mainly reflecting Treasury financings. Growth in the money supply slowed in February, while flows into bank time and savings accounts expanded moderately. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resistance of inflationary pressures and progress toward reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to attaining somewhat firmer conditions in the money market; provided, however, that operations shall be further modified if bank credit appears to be expanding more rapidly than is currently projected.",,

Maisel, Mitchell, and Robertson dissenting, the Committee authorized the Special Manager to undertake negotiations looking toward increases in a number of the System swap lines, on the understanding that any such increases and corresponding amendments to paragraph 2 of the authorization for System foreign currency operations would become effective upon a determination by Chairman Martin that they were in the national interest. Negotiations were authorized for increases in the swap lines with the following foreign banks to new levels not exceeding the amounts indicated (millions of dollars equivalent): National Bank of Belgium 400  Bank of Canada 1,000 Bank of Italy 1,000",,

On March 17 Chairman Martin made the same determination with respect to an increase in the swap line with the Bank of Sweden to $250 million equivalent.

It was understood that such increases and the corresponding amendments to paragraph 2 of the authorization for System foreign currency operations would become effective upon a determination by Chairman Martin that they were in the national interest.

As a result of these actions, the table contained in paragraph 2 of the authorization for System foreign currency  operations was amended, effective March 17, 1968, to read as  follows:  Amount of  arrangement  (millions of  Foreign bank dollars equivalent) Austrian National Bank 100 National Bank of Belgium 225 Bank of Canada 1,000 National Bank of Denmark 100 Bank of England 2,000 Bank of France 100 German Federal Bank 1,000 Bank of Italy 750 Bank of Japan 1,000 Bank of Mexico 130 Netherlands Bank 400 Bank of Norway 100 Bank of Sweden 250 Swiss National Bank 600 Bank fr International Settlements: System drawings in Swiss francs 600 System drawings in authorized European  currencies other than Swiss francs 1,000  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was  authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to",,

19680430,"4/30/68 -4 The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that over-all economic activity has expanded at a very rapid pace thus far in 1968, with prices rising substantially, and that prospects are for a continuing rapid advance in activity and persisting inflationary pressures in the period ahead. Since late fall, growth rates of bank credit, the money supply, and time and savings accounts at financial institutions have on balance moderated considerably. Market interest rates have risen in recent weeks, partly in reaction to the firming of monetary policy including the further increase in Federal Reserve discount rates. The U.S. foreign trade balance has worsened further, and the international payments position of the United States continues to be a matter of serious concern. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resistance of inflationary pressures and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of Treasury financing activity, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the firmer conditions prevailing in the money market; provided, however, that operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by Treasury financing, if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.

Secretary's Note: On July 18, 1968, the following letter was sent to the Secretary of the Treasury over the Chairman's signature:  I am enclosing a memorandum prepared by the Manager of the System Open Market Account regarding the handling of System subscriptions to Treasury refunding offerings in the light of recent innovations in Treasury debt management techniques.  These innovations--which involved combining an exchange offering of new securities with a cash offering--have a number of obvious advantages from the point of view of debt management and System operations. There is, however, a disadvantage in that--for practical  reasons--the System's options for exchanging its holdings of maturing issues are limited. As a result, the System's",,
19680716,"7/16/68 -5 subscriptions tend to be predetermined by the Treasury's choice of a particular debt management technique--a situation that may not be the best for monetary management, This anomalous situation could be avoided if the suggestions contained in the memorandum were adopted by the Treasury and I commend them to you.  I emphasize that what is involved is a technical problem and not a question of basic relationships between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. I know that we both feel strongly that any Treasury offering must meet the test of the market and that the Treasury does not want to lock to special System support of its financing operations. I am sure that we would agree also that it is essential for the Federal Reserve to have ample facilities for rolling over its holdings cf maturing issues, including the possibility of subscribing to both long- and short-term issues in any optional Treasury refunding operation.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank cf New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that over-all economic activity continued to expand rapidly in the second quarter, with inventory accumulation accelerating while the rise in capital outlays and in consumer spending slowed. The new fiscal restraint measures are expected to contribute to a considerable moderation of the rate of advance in aggregate demands. Industrial prices have been increasing less rapidly than earlier but consumer prices have continued to rise substantially and wage pressures remain strong. Growth in bank credit and time and savings deposits has been moderate on average in recent months; growth in the money supply has been larger as U.S. Government deposits have been reduced. Conditions in money and capital markets have eased somewhat, mainly in response to the increase in fiscal restraint. Although there recently have been large inflows of foreign capital, the U.S.",,

Expansion in overall activity, however, is projected to slow considerably in coming months as a result of the new fiscal restraint measures and a marked reduction in inventory accumulation. Industrial prices have been increasing less rapidly in recent months, but consumer prices have continued to rise substantially. Wage pressures remain strong, and the recent wage settlement in the steel industry was followed by announcements of steel price increases.  Both short- and long-term interest rates have declined considerably, in large part as a result of expectations of easier credit conditions. Bank time and savings deposits, particularly large-denomination CD's, have expanded sharply in early summer; growth in the money supply has continued large as U.S. Government deposits have been drawn down further on average; and growth in total bank credit has been unusually rapid.

19690304,"3/4/69 -8 The Federal Open Market Committee hereby authorizes each Federal Reserve Bank to take any or all of the actions set forth below during war or defense emergency when such Federal Reserve Bank finds itself unable after reasonable efforts to be in communication with the Federal Open Market Committee (or with the Interim Committee acting in lieu of the Federal Open Market Committee) or when the Federal Open Market Committee (or such Interim Committee) is unable to function,  (1) Whenever it deems it necessary in the light of economic conditions and the general credit situation then prevailing (after taking into account the possibility of providing necessary credit through advances secured by direct obligations of the United States under the last paragraph of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act), such Federal Reserve Bank may purchase and sell obligations of the United States for its own account, either outright or under repurchase agreement, from and to banks, dealers, or other holders of such obligations.  (2) In case any prospective seller of obligations of the United States to a Federal Reserve Bank is unable to tender the actual securities representing such obligations because of conditions resulting from the emergency, such Federal Reserve Bank may, in its discretion and subject to such safeguards as it deems necessary, accept from such seller, in lieu of the actual securities, a “due bill"" executed by the seller in form acceptable to such Federal Reserve Bank stating in substantial effect that the seller is the owner of the obligations which are the subject of the purchase, that ownership of such obligations is thereby transferred to the Federal Reserve Bank, and that the obligations themselves will be delivered to the Federal Reserve Bank as soon as possible.  (3) Such Federal Reserve Bank may in its discretion purchase special certificates of indebtedness directly from the United States in such amounts as may be needed to cover overdrafts in the general account of the Treasurer of the United States on the books of such Bank or for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, but such Bank shall take all steps practicable at the time to insure as far as possible that the amount of obligations acquired directly from the United States and held by it, together",,

Authority to take the actions set forth shall be effective only until such time as the Federal Reserve Bank is able again to establish communications with the Federal Open Market Committee (or the Interim Committee), and such Committee is then functioning.  By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed the authorization, first given at the meeting on December 16, 1958, providing for System personnel assigned to the Office of Emergency Preparedness, Special Facilities Division, on a rotating basis to have access to the resolutions (1) providing for continued operation of the Committee during an emergency and (2) authorizing certain actions by the Federal Reserve Banks during an emergency.

Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as practicable, considering needs for minimum working balances. Such investments shall be in accordance with Section 14(e) of the Federal Reserve Act.  6. A Subcommittee consisting of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Committee and the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors (or in the absence of the Chairman or of the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors the members of the Board designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee his alternate) is authorized to act on behalf of the Committee when it is necessary to enable the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to engage in foreign currency operations before the Committee can be consulted, All actions taken by the Subcommittee under this paragraph shall be reported promptly to the Committee,  7.

The Special Manager of the System Open Market Account for foreign currency operations shall keep the Committee informed on conditions in foreign exchange markets and on transactions he has made and shall render such reports as the Committee may specify.  By unanimous vote, the foreign currency directive given below was reaffirmed: FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE  1. The basic purposes of System operations in foreign currencies are:  A. To help safeguard the value of the dollar in international exchange markets ;  B. To aid in making the system of international payments more efficient;  c. To further monetary cooperation with central banks of other countries having convertible currencies, with the International Monetary Fund, and with other international payments institutions;  D. To help insure that market movements in exchange rates, within the limits stated in the International Monetary Fund Agreement or established by central bank practices, reflect the interaction of",,
19690304,"3/4/69 -17 underlying economic forces and thus serve as efficient guides to current financial decisions, private and public; and  E. To facilitate growth in international liquidity in accordance with the needs of an expanding world economy,  2. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee, System operations in foreign currencies shall be undertaken only when necessary:  A. To cushion or moderate fluctuations in the flows of international payments, if such fluctuations (1) are deemed to reflect transitional market unsettlement or other temporary forces and therefore are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future; and (2) are deemed to be dis-equilibrating or otherwise to have potentially destabilizing effects on U.S. or foreign official reserves or on exchange markets, for example, by occasioning market anxieties, undesirable speculative activity, or excessive leads and lags in international payments ;  B. To temper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates, and to moderate forward premiums and discounts judged to be dis-equilibrating. Whenever supply or demand persists in influencing exchange rates in one direction, System transactions should be modified or curtailed unless upon review and reassessment of the situation the Committee directs otherwise;  Cc, To aid in avoiding disorderly conditions in exchange markets. Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions. Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Special Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to reestablish supply and",,
19690304,"3/4/69 -18 demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments. In such cases, the Special Manager shall consult as soon as practicable with the Committee or, in an emergency, with the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for System foreign currency operations; and  D. To adjust System balances within the limits established in the Authorization for System foreign currency operations in light of probable future needs for currencies.  3. System drawings under the swap arrangements are appropriate when necessary to obtain foreign currencies for the purposes stated in paragraph 2 above,  4, Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, transactions in forward exchange, either outright or in conjunction with spot transactions, may be undertaken only (i) to prevent forward premiums or discounts from giving rise to dis-equilibrating movements of short-term funds; (ii) to minimize speculative disturbances; (iii) to supplement existing market supplies of forward cover, directly or indirectly, as a means of encouraging the retention or accumulation of dollar holdings by private foreign holders; (iv) to allow greater flexibility in covering System or Treasury commitments, including commitments under swap arrangements, and to facilitate operations of the Stabilization Fund; (v) to facilitate the use of one currency for the settlement of System or Treasury commitments denominated in other currencies; and (vi) to provide cover for System holdings of foreign currencies.  By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 4, through March 3, 1969, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government  securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the",,
19690304,"3/4/69 -19 period February 4 through March 3, 1969, were approved, ratified, and confirmed,  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that expansion in real economic activity has been moderating, but that upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Prospects are for some further slowing in economic expansion in the period ahead. Most market interest rates have edged up on balance in recent weeks. In the first two months of the year bank credit changed little on average, as investments contracted while loan demands, especially from businesses, remained strong. The outstanding volume of Large-denomination CD's continued to decline sharply and inflows of other time and savings deposits slowed. Growth in the money supply moderated as U.S. Government deposits rose considerably, It appears that a sizable deficit reemerged in the U.S. balance of payments on the liquidity basis in January and February and, with Euro-dollar inflows moderating, a deficit also reappeared in the balance on the official settlements basis in February, In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining on balance about the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections,",,

With Messrs.

Substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Most long-term interest rates have risen further on balance in recent weeks, but movements in short-term rates have been mixed. In the first quarter of the year bank credit changed little on average, as investments contracted while loans expanded further, In March the outstanding volume of large denomination CD's continued to decline sharply; inflows of other time and savings deposits were moderate; and  growth in the money supply remained at a sharply reduced rate. It appears that a sizable deficit reemerged in",,

In this Situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets, taking account of the effects of other possible monetary policy action; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.

At the same time, substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Long-term interest rates have generally declined in recent weeks, but most short-term rates have risen somewhat, In the first quarter of the year bank credit changed little on average and the money supply grew at a sharply reduced rate. In early April both measures increased substantially, influenced in part by large tax-date borrowing and deposit bulges around Easter. The outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's has continued to decline and there was a net outflow of consumer-type time and savings",,

S. balance of payments on the liquidity basis in the first quarter but the balance on the official settlements basis remained in surplus as a result of large inflows of Euro-dollars. In this situation, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury refunding, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified, to the extent permitted by the Treasury refunding, if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.

19690527,"5/27/69 -5 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that expansion in real economic activity is continuing to moderate slightly, but that substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Interest rates have risen in recent weeks. Bank credit and the money supply appear to be changing little on average in May after bulging in April. The outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's has continued to decline, and the available evidence suggests only modest recovery in other time and savings deposits at banks and in savings balances at nonbank thrift institutions following the outflows of the first half of April. The U.S. balance of payments on the liquidity basis was in sizable deficit in the first 4 months of 1969 but the balance on the official settlements basis remained in surplus as a result of large inflows of Euro-dollars. However, there were substantial outflows of funds from the United States in the first half of May, during the period of intense speculation on a revaluation of the German mark, and the payments balance was in very large deficit on both bases. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging a more sustainable rate of economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing pressure on money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.

Most market interest rates have risen considerably on balance in recent weeks, as credit demands continued strong against the background of considerable restraint on the banking system.

Very heavy Euro-dollar borrowing by U.S. banks through their foreign branches produced a large surplus in the balance of payments on the official settlements basis after mid-May.

19691007,"10/7/69 -5 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the pace of expansion in real economic activity was sustained in the third quarter by an acceleration of inventory investment, which about offset a further slackening in growth of private final sales. Some monthly economic measures have weakened recently, and slower over-all growth is projected for the fourth quarter Substantial upward pressures on prices and costs are persisting. Most market interest rates recently have risen to new highs as demands for funds have pressed against limited supplies. In September, on average, the money supply changed little as U.S. Government deposits rose considerably further, and bank credit increased slightly after 2 months of substantial decline. The outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's decreased further in September, and flows of consumer-type time and savings funds at banks and nonbank thrift institutions appear to have remained relatively weak. The U.S. foreign trade surplus increased a little in August. In August and September the deficit in the over-all balance of payments on the liquidity basis was very large, although not as large as in preceding months; and the official settlements balance, which had been in surplus for more than a year, shifted into deficit, reflecting slackened Euro-dollar borrowing by U.S. banks and new speculative flows into Germany. Exchange market tensions were reduced somewhat when the German Government decided to cease temporarily official sales of marks, after which the exchange rate for that currency rose above the official parity. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging sustainable economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections.

Slower over-all growth is projected for the fourth quarter, although some cross-currents have been evident in the recent behavior of monthly economic measures. Prices and costs are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. Most market interest rates have declined considerably on balance from their recent highs, in large part because of changing expectations, In the third quarter, average monthly bank credit declined and the money supply changed little; in October it appears that bank credit is decreasing further on average but that the money supply is growing somewhat. In recent weeks the net contraction of outstanding large-denomination CD's slowed markedly, apparently reflecting mainly an increase in foreign official time deposits, but flows of consumer-type time and savings funds at banks and nonbank thrift institutions appear to have remained relatively weak. The U.S. foreign trade surplus increased further in September, but the deficit in the overall balance of payments was still large on the liquidity basis and even larger on the official settlements basis, The appreciation of the German mark since the end of September, culminating in the revaluation of the official parity, has led to a partial reversal of speculative flows, and conditions in the Euro-dollar market have eased.

Prices and costs, however, are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. Most market interest rates have again been advancing in recent weeks, in many cases reaching new highs as a result of demand pressures, including heavy Treasury and foreign official bill sales, and a reversal of earlier market expectations partly stemming from growing concern about the outlook for fiscal policy. In October bank credit declined on average and the money supply changed little, but both appear to be increasing relatively rapidly in November. Recently the net contraction of outstanding large-denomination CD's has slowed markedly, apparently reflecting mainly an increase in foreign official time deposits. However, flows of consumer-type time and savings funds at banks and nonbank thrift institutions have remained weak. In the third quarter a small surplus in U.S. foreign trade re-emerged, but there was another very large deficit in the over-all balance of payments on the liquidity basis and the official settlements balance, which had been in surplus earlier, was also in deficit. More recently, return flows out of the German mark have apparently contributed to some short-run improvement in the U.S. payments position. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging sustainable economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining the prevailing firm conditions in money and short-term credit markets; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if bank credit appears to be deviating significantly from current projections or if pressures arise in connection with possible bank regulatory changes.",,
19691125,"11/25/69 -5By unanimous vote, the following letter was approved:  Mr. John F. Hahn, 3700 Bailey, Apt. 305, Los Angeles, California. 90034  Dear Mr. Hahn:  In response to your letter of September 19, 1969, and pursuant to section 271.6 of its Rules Regarding Availability of Information, the Federal Open Market Committee has reviewed your request for access to certain Committee records. Your letter requested such review following an earlier exchange of correspondence between you and Charles Molony, and was prompted by Mr. Molony's indication that certain Committee records are not available for public inspection.  The first two items in your appeal (questions 5 and 6 of your inquiry) involve staff memoranda, briefings, and reports in connection with any Committee meeting in 1969 and minutes of discussion at such meetings in 1968 and 1969. With respect to these records, the Committee has sustained the determination reported to you by Mr. Molony. The Committee has adopted procedures intended to inform the public of its actions as fully and as promptly as possible without compromising the effectiveness of those actions. To that end, an extensive summary record of policy actions is published by the Committee, and action minutes are also available for public inspection, with deferrals of generally about 90 days. Disclosure of the materials which you request would unnecessarily inhibit the free discussion essential to a reasoned group judgment, and would also reveal actions considered but deferred or not taken, with possible adverse effects on both public and private interests. For these reasons, the Committee relies upon the exemption from public disclosure provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5), and declines to make such material available for public inspection.  Your letter also requests a review of the denial of access to data regarding specific securities transactions with individual dealers. You explain that your interest is in determining the amount of profit made by dealers on such transactions, and indicate that, at this time at least, you are not interested in data with respect to any particular dealer. This casts a somewhat different light on the issue, since it was previously understood that you were requesting access to the",,
19691125,"11/25/69 -6 records of transactions with individual and specified dealers. The Committee would sustain Mr. Molony's ruling with respect to transactions revealing the identity of individual dealers, but information as to the prices at which securities were purchased and sold in the conduct of System open market operations would be provided, without identification of individual dealers and subject to a reasonable time lag. We should note, however, that this information will in fact shed little light on profits  made by dealers on transactions with the Federal Reserve.  It should also be noted that this material, even for a relatively brief time span, would be voluminous, and its assembly would be very time-consuming for our staff and consequently costly to you under the fees chargeable for search time. A compilation very similar to that in which you express an interest was prepared several years ago in response to a Congressional inquiry. While this particular compilation is not current, it could be provided fairly promptly and at little cost; you might therefore wish to inspect it as a first step and make a judgment in that light as to whether, and to what extent, you wish to inquire further into the matter.  Secretary's note: The letter was transmitted over Mr. Holland's signature later in the day.  By unanimous vote, the Committee approved the release with a reasonable time lag to any person on request of certain documents held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, described in a staff memorandum of November 12, 1969, in supplementation of the list of such documents that had been approved for release on June 20, 1967.

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real economic activity leveled off in the fourth quarter of 1969 and that little change is in prospect for the early part of 1970. Prices and costs, however, are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. Most market interest rates have receded from highs reached during December. Bank credit and the money supply increased slightly on average in December and also over the fourth quarter as a whole. Outstanding large-denomination CD's held by domestic depositors have continued to contract in recent months while foreign official time deposits have expanded considerably. Flows of consumer-type time and savings funds at banks and nonbank thrift institutions have remained weak, and there apparently were sizable net outflows after year-end interest crediting. U.S. imports and exports have both grown further in recent months but through November the trade balance showed Little or no further improvement from the third-quarter level. At the year end the over-all balance of payments statistics were buoyed by large temporary inflows of U.S. corporate funds. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the orderly",,
19700115,"1/15/70 Ae  reduction of inflationary pressures, with a view to encouraging sustainable economic growth and attaining reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury refunding, possible bank regulatory changes and the Committee's desire to see a modest growth in money and bank credit, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining firm conditions in the money market; provided, however, that operations shall be modified if money and bank credit appear to be deviating significantly from current projections.  By unanimous vote, transfer to the National Archives of the minutes of the Committee for the years 1962-65, inclusive, on the basis described in a memorandum from the Secretariat dated January 8, 1970, was authorized.

Prices and costs, however, are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. Long-term market interest rates recently have fluctuated under the competing influences of heavy demands for funds and shifts in investor attitudes regarding the outlook for monetary policy.

To cushion or moderate fluctuations in the flows of international payments, if such fluctuations (1} are deemed to reflect transitional market unsettlement or other temporary forces and therefore are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future; and (2) are deemed to be dis-equilibrating or otherwise to have potentially destabilizing effects on U.S. or foreign official reserves or on exchange markets, for example, by occasioning market anxieties, undesirable speculative activity, or excessive leads and lags in international payments;  B. To temper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates, and to moderate forward premiums and discounts judged to be dis-equilibrating.

Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions. Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Special Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to reestablish supply and demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments. In such cases, the Special Manager shall consult as soon as practicable with the Committee or, in an emergency, with the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for System foreign currency operations; and  D. To adjust System balances within the limits established in the Authorization for System foreign currency operations in light of probable future needs for currencies.  3. System drawings under the swap arrangements are appropriate when necessary to obtain foreign currencies for the purposes stated in paragraph 2 above.  4, Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, transactions in forward exchange, either outright or in conjunction with spot transactions, may be undertaken only (i) to prevent forward premiums or discounts from giving rise to dis-equilibrating movements of short-term funds; (ii) to minimize speculative disturbances; (iii) to supplement existing market supplies of forward cover, directly or indirectly, as a means of encouraging the retention or accumulation of dollar holdings by private foreign holders; (iv) to allow greater flexibility in covering System or Treasury commitments, including commitments under swap arrangements, and to facilitate operations of the Stabilization Fund; (¥) to facilitate the use of one currency for the settlement of System or Treasury",,

19700310,"3/10/70 -21 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real economic activity, which leveled off in the fourth quarter of 1969, is weakening further in early 1970. Prices and costs, however, are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, Market interest rates have declined considerably in recent weeks, partly as a result of changing investor attitudes regarding the outlook for economic activity and monetary policy.  Both bank credit and the money supply declined on average in February, but both were tending upward in the latter part of the month. Outflows of time and savings funds at banks and nonbank thrift institutions, which had been sizable in January, apparently ceased in February, reflecting advances in rates offered on such funds following the recent increases in regulatory ceilings, together with declines in short-term market interest rates. The U.S. foreign trade surplus  narrowed in January and the over-all balance of payments deficit has remained large in recent weeks. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while encouraging the resumption of sustainable economic growth and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee desires to see moderate growth in money and bank credit over the months ahead.

Fiscal stimulus, of dimensions that are still uncertain, will strengthen income expansion in the near term. Most long-term interest rates backed up during much of March under the pressure of heavy demands for funds, but then turned down in response to indications of some relaxation of monetary policy and to the reduction in the prime lending rate of banks. Short-term rates declined further on balance in recent weeks, contributing to the ability of banks and other thrift institutions to attract time and savings funds. Both bank credit and the money supply rose on average in March; over the first quarter as a whole bank credit was about unchanged on balance and the money supply increased somewhat, The U.S. foreign trade surplus increased in February, but the over-all balance of payments appears to have been in considerable deficit during the first quarter. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while encouraging the resumption of sustainable economic growth and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.

Prices and costs generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, although some components of major price indexes recently have shown moderating tendencies.

However, improvements in productivity appear to be slowing the rise in costs, and some major price measures are showing moderating tendencies, Since mid-June long-term interest rates have declined considerably, and prices of common stocks have fluctuated above their recent lows. Although conditions in financial markets have improved in recent weeks uncertainties persist, particularly in the commercial paper market where the volume of outstanding paper has contracted sharply. A large proportion of the funds so freed apparently was re-channeled through the banking system, as suggested by sharp increases in bank loans and in large-denomination cD's of short maturity--for which rate ceilings were suspended in late June, Consequently, in early July bank credit grew rapidly; there was also a sharp increase in the money supply. Over the second quarter as a whole both bank credit and money supply rose moderately, The over-all balance of payments remained in heavy deficit in the second quarter.

(3) Such Federal Reserve Bank may in its discretion purchase special certificates of indebtedness directly from the United States in such amounts as may be needed to cover overdrafts in the general account of the Treasurer of the United States on the books of such Bank or for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, but such Bank shall take all steps practicable at the time to insure as far as possible that the amount of obligations acquired directly from the United States and held by it, together with the amount of such obligations so acquired and held by all other Federal Reserve Banks, does not exceed $5 billion at any one time.  (4) Such Federal Reserve Bank may engage in operations of the types specified in the Committee's authorization for System foreign currency operations when requested to do so by an authorized official of the U.S. Treasury Department; provided, however, that such Bank shall take all steps practicable at the time to insure as far as possible that, in light of the information available on other System foreign currency operations, its own operations do not result in the aggregate in breaching any of the several dollar limits specified in the authorization.  Authority to take the actions set forth shall be effective only until such time as the Federal Reserve Bank is able again to establish communications with the Federal  Open Market Committee (or the Interim Committee), and such Committee is then functioning.

Staats, Comptroller General of the United States, over the signature of  Mr. Holland. This letter was in response to Mr, Staats' letter of June 30, 1970, quoted immediately below, to Chairman Burns.  Dear Mr. Burns:  The Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress has asked the General Accounting Office to review the accounting standards and practices of dealers in Federal Government securities in relation to their reporting to the Federal Reserve System. A copy of the Chairman's request has been furnished to Mr. Peter Keir of your staff.  The Committee is concerned with the soundness of the dealers' accounting in support of the data they report to the Federal Reserve System, in the reliability and adequacy of these data, and in the accuracy of the reported profits taking into account the methods of allocating expenses.  Our review is to be directed entirely to these matters through interview, interrogation and observation of dealers’ activities. The knowledge and experience of officials of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York who are involved with the dealers' operations and reporting could provide valuable insight as a basis for our review approach and possibly for an entree to the dealers selected.  We plan to secure our basic data directly from the dealers and to rely on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to validate such data from the Bank's reports and records if needed. This should avoid any question of compromising confidential data reported to the Bank by the dealers.  In view of the Committee's interest in speedy completion of our review, we would very much appreciate your cooperation in arranging with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to assist our representatives and give them the benefit of their expertise.",,
19700721,"7/21/70 -7Dear Mr, Staats:  I am replying to your letter of June 30, 1970, in which you asked for assistance in responding to a request from Chairman Patman of the Joint Economic Committee who asked for a review of the accounting standards and practices used by U.S. Government securities dealers in their reports to the Federal Reserve System. It is our understanding that the General Accounting Office would secure the necessary information for complying with Chairman Patman's request by direct interviews and observation of the dealers' activities and that the necessary basic data would be obtained directly from the dealers. The Federal Reserve, notably officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, would undertake to provide the GAO staff with technical advice and might in addition be asked to validate from the records of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York data which the dealers will provide.  Members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which has jurisdiction in this area, have indicated their willingness to have the Federal Reserve cooperate in this study in the manner you have outlined. It is their understanding that the confidential nature of the dealers' reports to the System would be protected and on this basis they interpose no objection to proceeding promptly with the study.  lye Kilo  Secretary",,

By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on July 21, 1970, were approved.

With Messrs. Hayes, Brimmer, and Francis dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real economic activity, which edged up slightly in the second quarter after declining appreciably earlier in the year, may be expanding somewhat further. Prices and wage rates generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. However, improvements in productivity appear to be slowing the rise in costs, and some major price measures are showing moderating tendencies, Credit demands in securities markets have continued heavy, and interest rates have shown mixed changes since midJuly after declining considerably in preceding weeks. Some uncertainties persist in financial markets, particularly in connection with market instruments of less than prime grade. In July the money supply rose moderately on average and bank credit expanded substantially. Banks increased holdings of securities and loans to finance companies, some of which were experiencing difficulty in refinancing maturing commercial paper. Banks sharply expanded their outstanding large-denomination CD's of short maturity, far which rate ceilings had been suspended in late June, and both banks and nonbank thrift institutions experienced large net inflows of consumer-type time and savings funds. The over-all balance of payments remained in heavy deficit in the second quarter,",,
19700818,"8/18/70 -4 despite a sizable increase in the export surplus.  In July the official settlements deficit continued  large, but there apparently was a marked shrinkage  in the liquidity deficit. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, while encouraging the resumption of sustainable economic growth and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote some easing of conditions in credit markets and somewhat greater growth in money over the months ahead than occurred in the second quarter, while taking account of possible liquidity problems and allowing bank credit growth to reflect any continued shift of credit flows from market to banking channels. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with that objective, taking account of the effects of other monetary policy actions.

Part but not all of the weakness in overall activity is attributable to the strike in the automobile industry which apparently is now coming to an end. Wage rates generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, but gains in productivity appear to be slowing the increase in unit labor costs. Recent movements in major price measures have been erratic but the general pace of advance in these measures has tended to slow. Most interest rates declined considerably in the past few weeks, and Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced by one-quarter of a percentage point in the week of November 9. Demands for funds in capital markets have continued heavy, but business loan demands at banks have weakened.

With Mr. Francis dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services declined in the fourth quarter of 1970, Largely as a consequence of the recent strike in the automobile industry. Unemployment increased further in December, The resumption of higher automobile production is expected to result in a bulge in activity in early 1971. Wage rates generally are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, but gains in productivity appear to be slowing the increase in unit labor costs, The rise in both wholesale and consumer prices appears to have moderated recently, following substantial increases earlier in the fall. Most market interest rates turned down again in recent days, and Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced by an additional one-quarter of a percentage point. Demands for funds in capital markets have continued heavy, but business loan demands at banks remain weak, Although growth in the money supply accelerated in December, over the fourth quarter as a whole it was at a rate below that prevailing in the preceding three quarters. Banks made substantial further additions to their holdings of securities in December, and bank credit increased sharply. The foreign trade surplus has declined markedly in recent months. The over-all balance of payments deficit on the liquidity basis in the fourth",,

To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote accommodative conditions in credit markets and moderate expansion in monetary and credit aggregates. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining bank reserves and money market conditions consistent with those objectives, taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing.

With Mr. Francis dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services, which declined in the fourth quarter of 1970, is rising in the current quarter primarily because of the resumption of higher automobile production. The unemployment rate remained high in January. Wage rates in most sectors are continuing to rise at a rapid pace, and recent increases  in some major price measures have been relatively large, Interest rates have fallen considerably further in recent",,
19710209,"2/9/71 -he  weeks despite continued heavy demands for funds in capital markets, and differentials between interest  rates in the United States and those in major foreign countries have widened further. Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced by an additional one-quarter of a percentage point to 5 percent. Bank credit increased considerably further in January, as business loan demands strengthened somewhat and banks made substantial further additions to their holdings of securities. The money stock narrowly defined grew modestly in January following a stronger December rise, but money more broadly defined expanded sharply further as a result of continued rapid growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits. The over-all balance of payments deficit in the fourth quarter was about as large as in the third quarter on  the liquidity basis; on the official settlements basis the deficit increased further from the very high third quarter level as banks continued to repay Euro-dollar liabilities. More recently, the issuance of a special Export-Import Bank security to foreign branches of  U.S. banks helped to moderate the flow of dollars to foreign central banks. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy cf the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to  the resumption of sustainable economic growth, while encouraging an orderly reduction in the rate of inflation and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in  the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to maintaining prevailing money market conditions while accommodating additional downward movements in long-term rates; provided that money market conditions shall promptly be eased somewhat further if it appears that the monetary aggregates are falling short of the growth path desired.

Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions. Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Special Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to reestablish supply and demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments, In such cases, the Special Manager shall consult as soon as practicable with the Committee or,",,

Although the unemployment rate has edged down recently, it remains high. Wage rates in most sectors are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. Movements in major price measures have been diverse; most recently, the rate of advance moderated for consumer prices and wholesale prices of industrial commodities, but wholesale prices of farm products and foods rose sharply, Bank credit increased considerably further in February, as business Loans strengthened substantially and banks again made sizable additions to their holdings of securities. The money stock both narrowly and broadly defined expanded sharply in February. Short-term interest rates and mortgage rates have fallen further in recent weeks but yields on new issues of corporate and municipal bonds have risen considerably, in part as a result of the very heavy calendar of offerings. The over-all balance of payments deficit in January and February was exceptionally large. Imports increased more rapidly than exports in January, and capital outflows have been stimulated by widened short term interest rate differentials, In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the resumption of sustainable economic growth, while encouraging an orderly reduction in the rate of inflation and the attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country’s balance of payments.

By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period March 9 through April 5, 1971, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  With Messrs. Hayes and Kimbrel dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services rose substantially in the first quarter primarily because of the resumption of higher automobile production, but that the unemployment rate remained high. More moderate growth in real GNP appears to be in prospect for the current quarter. Wage rates in most sectors are continuing to rise at a rapid pace. The rate of advance in consumer prices and in wholesale prices of industrial commodities appears to have moderated recently.  In March bank credit and the money stock both narrowly and broadly defined again expanded substantially, although the increases were less sharp than in February. Inflows of consumer-type time and savings funds to hanks and nonbank thrift institutions reached unusually high levels in the first quarter as interest rates on competitive short-term market instruments declined considerably further. In recent weeks, however, key short term interest rates have moved up somewhat on balance. Yields on new issues of corporate and municipal bonds",,
19710406,"4/6/71. -4 declined during much of March despite a continuing heavy calendar of offerings, but most recently longterm market yields have also risen somewhat. The overall balance of payments deficit in the first quarter was exceptionally large. The trade surplus for the first two months was very small, and capital outflows have been stimulated by wide short-term interest rate differentials. Despite recent reductions in the discount rates of several European central banks, these differentials remain wide. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to the resumption of sustainable economic growth, while encouraging an orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, moderation of short-term capital outflows, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the Treasury financing the terms of which are to be announced late in the month, System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to attaining temporarily sone minor firming in money market conditions, while continuing to meet some part of reserve needs through purchases of coupon issues in the interest of promoting accommodative conditions in long-term credit markets; provided that money market conditions shall be modified if it appears that the monetary and credit aggregates are deviating significantly from the growth paths desired.

The rate of advance in consumer prices and in wholesale prices of industrial commodities moderated in the first quarter, but the rise in industrial prices stepped up again in April. The money stock both narrowly and broadly defined expanded substantially further in April but growth in bank credit slowed. Inflows of consumer-type time and savings funds to banks moderated, partly as a result of reductions in the interest rates offered by banks, but flows to nonbank thrift institutions continued heavy. Interest rates on most types of short and long-term market securities rose sharply in April and early May, reflecting uncertainties about domestic, and more recently international, financial prospects. The over-a11 balance of payments deficit in the first four months of 1971 was exceptionally large, in great part reflecting short-term capital outflows, Recently, after further large international flows of funds, several European central banks suspended sales of their currencies for dollars; subsequently, announcements were made that the German mark and Dutch guilder would be permitted  to float for the time being, and that the Swiss franc and Austrian schilling were being revalued.

The unemployment rate remained high in May. Wage rates in most sectors ere continuing to rise at a rapid pace. in the first four months of 1971 the consumer price index increased at a slower pace than earlier, in considerable part because of a decline in mortgage interest rates; the rate of advance in wholesale prices of industrial commodities, which had moderated in the first quarter, stepped up again in April and May. ‘The money stock both narrowly and broadly defined expanded even more rapidly in May than in April but growth in the bank credit proxy remained moderate.

Interest rates on most types of market securities have increased on balance in recent weeks. The market exchange rate for the German mark has advanced, and a substantial flow of funds from Germany to other markets has occurred in recent weeks.

In mid-July Federal Reserve discount rates were increased by one-quarter of a percentage point to 5 percent. The deficit in the U.S. balance of payments remained extraordinarily large in the second quarter, mainly reflecting capital outflows related to expectations of shifts in foreign exchange rates and the development of a substantial deficit in the merchandise trade balance. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable economic growth, while encouraging an orderly reduction in the rate of inflation, moderation of short-term capital outflows, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, taking account of the current Treasury financing and of developments in capital markets, the Committee seeks to achieve more moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with those objectives.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, August 24, 1971, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Deputy Secretary",,

However, the economic program announced by the President on August 15 enhances prospects for higher rates of growth in real economic activity, increased job opportunities, and curtailed inflationary pressures. In July inflows of consumer type time and savings funds slowed markedly at banks but inflows to nonbank thrift institutions continued large. Growth in the narrowly defined money stock remained rapid in July, but growth in broadly defined money slowed and bank credit continued to expand at about the second-quarter pace. Interest rates on most types of market securities declined sharply in the days following the announcement of the new program. The deficit in the U.S. balance of payments reached extraordinarily large proportions in early August, mainly reflecting an acceleration of capital outflows related to expectations of shifts in foreign exchange rates. Following the suspension of convertibility  of the dollar into gold and other reserve assets, major European central banks discontinued foreign exchange market operations for a week. When most of the European markets were reopened on August 23 these central banks pursued diverse exchange rate policies, but all allowed at least some types of market transactions to take place at rates of exchange for their currencies relative to the dollar above previous upper intervention Limits. In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions consistent with the aims of the new governmental program, including sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to achieve more moderate growth in monetary and credit aggregates over the months ahead. System open market operations until the next meeting of the Committee shall be conducted with a view to achieving bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with that objective.  BY unanimous vote, paragraph 1(a} of the continuing authority directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with respect  to domestic open market operations was amended to read as follows:",,

In connection with the foregoing action, the Committee approved certain guidelines for the conduct of System operations in the securities cf Federal agencies.

19710921,"9/21/72 -5 output of goods and services is expanding modestly and unemployment remains substantial. Prior to the imposition of the 90-day freeze, prices and wages were rising rapidly on average. In August inflows of consumer-type time and savings funds to nonbank thrift institutions moderated and inflows to banks remained at a reduced rate. Growth in the narrowly defined money stock, which had been rapid through July, slowed sharply in August; and growth in broadly defined money continued  to slacken. However, the rate of expansion in the bank credit proxy stepped up, mainly reflecting a marked rise in U.S. Government deposits, Market interest rates, which declined sharply following the announcement of the new program, have since fluctuated irregularly. The U.S. balance of payments continues to be in a position of substantial basic deficit. Speculative capital outflows have diminished recently. Most major foreign currencies are trading in the exchange markets at rates against the dollar a few percent higher than on August 13. Negotiations have begun on additional measures to reduce payments imbalances and on other improvements in the international monetary system, In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the federal Open Marker Committee to foster financial conditions consistent with the aims of the new governmental program, including sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.

However, there are indications of a strengthening in economic activity since the mid-August announcement of the Government's new economic program. The 90-day freeze has thus far effectively limited increases in prices and wages, and the general framework of the post- freeze stabilization program has been established. The narrowly defined money stock, which had grown rapidly through July, increased much less in August and declined in September.

Available data indicate that the 90-day freeze effectively limited increases in price and wages, and basic policies for the post-freeze stabilization program have been announced.

Interest rates on both short- and long-term market securities have continued to decline in recent weeks and Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced by one-quarter of a percentage point to 4-3/4 percent. The U.S. foreign trade balance was raised in September by a sharp acceleration of export shipments in advance of an East Coast port strike.

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is increasing more rapidly in the current quarter than it had in the third quarter, but the unemployment rate remains high. Increases in prices and wages were effectively limited by the 90day freeze, which ended in mid-November. Since then some wage and price increases have occurred, but other increases requested have been cut back or not approved by the Pay Board and the Price Commission. The narrowly defined money stock changed little in November and has not grown on balance since August. Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks remained rapid in November and the broadly defined money stock continued to increase moderately.

The U.S. foreign trade balance was heavily in deficit in October. In recent weeks net outflows of short term capital apparently have been substantial, market exchange rates for foreign currencies against the dollar  on average have risen further, and official reserve holdings of some countries have increased considerably. In light  of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions consistent with the aims of the new governmental program, including sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, the Committee seeks to promote the degree of ease in bank reserve and money market conditions essential to greater growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

No such requests were received.  The authorizations in question were as follows: 1. Procedure for allocations of securities in the System Open Market Account. 2, Distribution list for periodic reports prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 3.

The Special Manager of the System Open Market Account for foreign currency operations shall keep the Committee informed on conditions in foreign exchange markets and on transactions he has made and shall render such reports as the Committee may specify.  By unanimous vote, the foreign currency directive, as shown below, was reaffirmed; FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE  1. The basic purposes of System operations in foreign currencies are:  A. To help safeguard the value of the dollar in international exchange markets;  B. To aid in making the system of international payments more efficient;  C. To further monetary cooperation with central banks of other countries having convertible currencies, with the International Monetary Fund, and with other international payments institutions;  D. To help insure that market movements in exchange rates, within the limits stated in the International Monetary Fund Agreement or established by central bank practices, reflect the interaction of underlying economic forces and thus serve as efficient guides to current financial decisions, private and public; and  E. To facilitate growth in international liquidity in accordance with the needs of an expanding world economy.  2. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee, System operations in foreign currencies shall be undertaken only when necessary:  A. To cushion or moderate fluctuations in the flows of international payments, if such fluctuations (1) are deemed to reflect transitional market unsettlement or other temporary forces and therefore are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future; and (2) are deemed to be dis-equilibrating or otherwise to have potentially destabilizing",,
19720321,"3/21/72 -17 effects on U.S. or foreign official reserves or on exchange markets, for example, by occasioning market anxieties, undesirable speculative activity, or excessive leads and  lags in international payments;  B. Te temper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates, and to moderate forward premiums and discounts judged to be dis-equilibrating. Whenever supply or demand persists in influencing exchange rates in one direction, System transactions should be modified or curtailed unless upon review and reassessment of the situation the Committee directs otherwise;  C. To aid in avoiding disorderly conditions in exchange markets. Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension,  (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions, Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Special Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to reestablish supply and demand balance at a  level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments. In such cases, the Special Manager shall consult as soon as practicable with the Committee or, in  an emergency, with the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for System foreign currency operations; and  D. To adjust System balances within the limits established in the Authorization for System foreign currency operations in light of probable future needs for currencies,  3. System drawings under the swap arrangements are appropriate when necessary to obtain foreign currencies for the purposes stated in paragraph 2 above.  4. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, transactions in forward exchange, either outright or in conjunction with spot transactions, may be undertaken only (i) to prevent forward premiums or discounts from giving rise to dis-equilibrating movements of short term funds; (ii) to minimize speculative disturbances;",,
19720321,"3/21/72 -18 (iii) to supplement existing market supplies of forward cover, directly or indirectly, as a means of encouraging the retention or accumulation of dollar holdings by private foreign holders; (iv) to allow greater flexibility in covering System or Treasury commitments, including commitments under swap arrangements, and to facilitate operations of the Stabilization Fund; (v) to facilitate the use of one currency for the settlement of System or Treasury commitments denominated in other currencies; and {vi) to provide cover for System holdings of foreign currencies.

19720418,"4/18/72 o4 By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services grew in the first quarter at about the stepped-up rate attained in the fourth quarter of 1971. Most measures of business activity have shown strength recently and demands for labor have improved further, but the unemployment rate remains high. The rise in wholesale prices slowed in March as some farm and food products declined sharply, but the rise in prices of industrial commodities remained substantial. Wage rates also rose substantially in March and over the first quarter as a whole. The dollar has strengthened somewhat in exchange markets in recent weeks, and the over-all U.S. balance of payments deficit on the official settlements basis has been small. In January and February merchandise imports continued to be considerably in excess of exports.  The narrowly defined money stock expanded rapidly in February and March, bringing the annual rate of growth over the past 6 months to about 5-1/4 percent. Inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks have been strong thus far this year, although they moderated as the first quarter progressed; inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained very large. Mainly reflecting swings in U.S. Government deposits, a modest increase in the bank credit proxy in February was followed by a large increase in March. Market interest rates generally have continued to rise in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to sustainable real economic growth and increased employment, abatement of inflationary pressures, and attainment of reasonable equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of capital market developments and the forthcoming Treasury financing, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support somewhat more moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.",,

Wholesale prices of farm and food products advanced appreciably further in June and the rise in prices of industrial commodities remained substantial. Recent data suggest moderation in the pace of advance in wage rates. In foreign exchange markets, following disturbances leading to a floating of the pound sterling, the dollar has come under pressure and the reserves of European central banks have increased sharply. In May, the excess of merchandise imports over exports remained Large, though a little less than in April.  Growth in the narrowly defined money stock was relatively slow in May and June, but preliminary weekly data suggest a pickup in early July. Growth in the broadly defined money stock was more substantial as inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks remained strong. Expansion in the bank credit proxy slowed sharply in June as U.S, Government deposits declined markedly, In recent weeks, long-term interest rates have changed little; rates in short term markets have advanced, except for those on shorter-maturity Treasury bills.",,

SECTION 272.4 - COMMITTEE ACTIONS  (a) Actions at meetings. Actions are taken at meetings of the Committee except as described below.  {b) Actions between meetings. - Special circumstances may make it desirable in the public interest for Committee members to consider an action to modify an outstanding Committee authorization or directive at a time when it is not feasible to call a meting.

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued substantial growth in real output of goods and services in the current quarter, although at a rate less rapid than in the fourth quarter of 1972, The unemployment rate has declined slightly further. In recent months wage rates have increased at a relatively rapid pace, and unit labor costs turned up in the fourth quarter of 1972, The rise in consumer prices slowed in December when retail prices of foods changed little, but prices of foods and foodstuffs at earlier stages of distribution rose sharply in both December and January, The excess of U.S. merchandise imports over exports remained large in December, Heavy speculative movements out of dollars into German marks and some other currencies developed in late January and early February. On February 12 the Government announced that the United States would devalue the dollar by 10 percent.  The narrowly defined money stock changed little in January after having increased sharply in December, and growth over the 2 months combined was at an average annual rate of about 6-1/2 percent. Growth in the more broadly defined money stock slowed less abruptly from December to January as inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks accelerated. A sharp and pervasive increase has taken place in bank loans to businesses, In recent weeks market interest rates generally have risen further, with increases substantial",,
19730213,"2/13/73 -4 for short-term rates and relatively moderate for longterm rates. Most recently, however, Treasury bill rates have moved back down under the influence of foreign official buying.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions consonant with the aims of the economic stabilization program, including further abatement of inflationary pressures, sustainable growth in real output and employment, and progress toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account  of possible domestic credit market and international  developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank  reserve and money market conditions that will support  somewhat slower growth in monetary aggregates over  the months ahead than occurred on average in the past  6 months.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open  Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 20, 1973, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary",,

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following current economic policy directive (later in this meeting retitled “domestic policy directive""):  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests continued substantial growth in real output of goods and services in the current quarter, although at a rate less rapid than in the fourth quarter of 1972. Over the first 2 months of this year, employment rose strongly but the unemployment rate remained about 5 percent. The advance in wage rates moderated from the earlier rapid pace, while the rate of increase in prices accelerated. Prices of foods continued to rise sharply both at wholesale and retail; in February, moreover, increases in wholesale prices of industrial commodities were large and widespread. Another wave of speculative movements out of dollars into German marks and some other currencies developed at the beginning of March and led to a decision by a number of European countries to float their currencies jointly. On March 16, after a series of meetings, officials of leading industrial countries announced a program aimed at maintaining orderly international monetary arrangements.  The narrowly defined money stock expanded moderately in February, after having changed little in January, and growth over recent months remained at an average annual rate of about 6.5 percent. The more broadly defined money stock continued to grow at a moderate rate in February as inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits to banks slowed sharply. However, in the face of strong loan demand from businesses, and also from",,
19730320,"3/20/73 -8 foreign banks, U.S. banks sharply increased their issuance of large-denomination CD's and the bank credit proxy expanded very rapidly. In recent weeks short-term market interest rates have risen substantially further while the rise in long-term rates has remained more moderate.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions consonant with the aims of the economic stabilization program, including abatement of inflationary pressures, sustainable growth in real output and employment, and progress toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments,  To implement this policy, while taking account of possible domestic credit market and international developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that will support somewhat slower growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than occurred on average in the past 6 months.  Consideration was then given to the continuing authorizations of the Committee, in accordance with the customary practice of reviewing such matters at the first meeting in March of every year.  Secretary's Note: It had been agreed at the meeting on March 10, 1970, that certain authorizations among those that the Committee had reviewed annually in the past would remain effective until otherwise directed by the Committee, and would no longer be submitted routinely for review each year. Instead, it was understood that these authorizations would be called to the Committee's attention before the first meeting in March of each year and that members would be given an opportunity to raise any questions they had concerning them.",,
19730320,"3/20/73 -9 Accordingly, copies of the authorizations in question (listed below) had been distributed to the Committee on February 21, 1973, with a request that members advise the Secretariat if they wished to have any placed on the agenda for consideration at today's meeting. No such requests were received,  The authorizations in question were as follows:  1, Procedure for allocations of securities in the System Open Market Account,  2. Distribution list for periodic reports prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  3. Authority for the Chairman to appoint a Federal Reserve Bank as agent to operate the System  Account in case the New York Bank was unable to function.  4, Resolutions providing for continued operation of the Committee, and for certain actions by the Reserve Banks, during an emergency.  5.

The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or, if the New York Reserve Bank is closed, any other Federal Reserve Bank, to purchase directly from the Treasury for its own account (with discretion, in cases where it seems desirable, to issue participations to one or more Federal Reserve Banks) such amounts of special short-term certificates of indebtedness as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury; provided that the rate charged on such certificates shall be a rate 1/4 of 1 percent below the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of such purchases, and provided further that the total amount of such certificates held at any one time by the Federal Reserve Banks shall not exceed $1 billion.",,

To further monetary cooperation with central banks of other countries having convertible currencies, with the International Monetary Fund, and with other international payments institutions;  D. To help insure that market movements in exchange rates, within the limits stated in the International Monetary Fund Agreement or established by central bank practices, reflect the interaction of underlying economic forces and thus serve as efficient guides to current financial decisions, private and public; and  E. To facilitate growth in international liquidity in accordance with the needs of an expanding world economy.",,

To cushion or moderate fluctuations in the flows of international payments, if such fluctuations (1) are deemed to reflect transitional market unsettlement or other temporary forces and therefore are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future; and (2) are deemed to be dis-equilibrating or otherwise to have potentially destabilizing effects on U.5. or foreign official reserves or on exchange markets, for example, by occasioning market anxieties, undesirable speculative activity, or excessive leads and lags in international payments;  B. To temper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates, and to moderate forward premiums and discounts judged to be dis-equilibrating, Whenever supply or demand persists in influencing exchange rates in one direction, System transactions should be modified or curtailed unless upon review and reassessment of the situation the Committee directs otherwise;  Cc. To aid in avoiding disorderly conditions in exchange markets. Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions. Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Special Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to reestablish supply and demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments. in such cases, the Special Manager shall consult as soon as practicable with the Committee or, in an emergency, with the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations; and",,

System drawings under the swap arrangements are appropriate when necessary to obtain foreign currencies for the purposes stated in paragraph 2 above.  4& Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, transactions in forward exchange, either outright or in conjunction with spot transactions, may be undertaken only (i) to prevent forward premiums or discounts from giving rise to dis-equilibrating movements of short-term funds; (ii) to minimize speculative disturbances; (iii) to supplement existing market supplies of forward cover, directly or indirectly, as a means of encouraging the retention or accumulation of dollar holdings by private foreign holders; (iv) to allow greater flexibility in covering System or Treasury commitments, including commitments under swap arrangements, and to facilitate operations of the Stabilization Fund; (v) to facilitate the use of one currency for the settlement of System or Treasury commitments denominated in other currencies; and (vi} to provide cover for System holdings of foreign currencies.

Foreign exchange markets have been relatively quiet since mid-March, and there has been a moderate reflow into dollars. The U.S. merchandise trade balance improved a little in JanuaryFebruary, when both exports and imports were sharply higher than in the fourth quarter of 1972.

Phase III controls affecting wages, profit margins, dividends, and interest rates remain in effect. Im foreign exchange markets, several European currencies have appreciated against the dollar by 7 to 10 percent since early May. The U.S. merchandise trade balance continued to improve in April, as exports other than agricultural products increased sharply further and imports dipped.  Following relatively slow growth earlier in the year, the narrowly defined money stock rose sharply in May and early June, Growth in consumer-type time and savings deposits changed little, while banks' net sales of large-denomination CD's declined further, On May 16 marginal reserve requirements were imposed on large-denomination CD's and the remaining Regulation Q ceilings on such CD's were suspended.

19730918,"9/18/73 -4 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services, which slowed in the second quarter from the exceptionally rapid Pace of the two preceding quarters, will be moderate in the third quarter. Although nonfarm employment rose sharply in August, the average gain in recent months has been smaller than earlier and the unemployment rate has changed little at a level somewhat below 5 percent. The exceptionally rapid advance in prices was interrupted in July by the temporary freeze imposed in mid-June. However, farm and food prices surged after mid-July--when the freeze was lifted on most such products--and despite later appreciable declines, they remained far above pre-freeze levels. The U.S. merchandise trade balance improved further in July, and net foreign purchases of U.S. stocks increased. In recent weeks exchange rates for the dollar against most foreign currencies have changed little on balance after strengthening in the first half of August, and the balance of payments has been in surplus on an official settlements basis.  The narrowly defined money stock, which had increased moderately in July, declined somewhat in August. The more broadly defined money stock continued to expand as a result of net inflows at banks of consumer-type time deposits. Nonbank thrift institutions experienced net deposit outflows in the July-August period. Expansion in bank credit has continued at a substantial pace. On September 7 the Federal Reserve announced an increase from 8 to 11 percent in marginal reserve requirements on large-denomination CD's. Interest rates on long-term market securities declined from early August to early September, partly because of growing expectations that the maximum degree of monetary restraint had been reached, Later, however, such expectations weakened and some long-term rates turned up. Short-term rates generally remained under upward pressure in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to abatement of inflationary pressures, a sustainable rate of advance in economic activity, and continued progress toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.",,

In foreign exchange markets, the dollar appreciated against major foreign currencies following announcement in late October of a large surplus in the U.S. merchandise trade balance, and the dollar strengthened markedly further in early November as expectations grew that the developing oil crisis would create particularly severe problems for Western Europe and Japan. In the third quarter and in October, the balance of payments on an official settlements basis was in substantial surplus.  The narrowly defined money stock, which had declined in August and September, rose moderately in October. The more broadly defined money stock expanded sharply as a result of large net inflows at banks of consumer-type time deposits, Net deposit inflows at nonbank thrift institutions improved somewhat further. Bank credit expansion remained moderate in October, reflecting in part a lack of growth in business loans as borrowers shifted to the commercial paper market, The outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's, which had begun to decline in late September, fell substantially further, Short-term market interest rates, while fluctuating widely, rose on balance from mid-October to midNovember.

A further weakening in activity and an appreciable rise in prices are in prospect because of the curtailment in oil supplies, In November nonfarm payroll employment expanded further, but the unemployment rate, which had dropped in October, rose again to about the level that had prevailed since midyear. Wholesale prices of industrial commodities continued to rise sharply in November, reflecting Large additional increases for petroleum products and widespread advances among other commodities; farm and food prices declined further,  In nearly all industrial countries abroad, concern has grown that a sustained cut in o11 supplies will disrupt economic activity. Major foreign currencies have depreciated further against the dollar, and intervention sales of dollars by foreign monetary authorities have continued, The U.S. merchandise trade balance registered a strong surplus in the September-October period.  The narrowly defined money stock, following little net change over the third quarter, has grown at a relatively rapid pace over the past 2 months, Growth in the more broadly defined money stock has also been substantial, as net inflows at banks of consumer-type time deposits have been large. Net deposit inflows at nonbank thrift institutions improved somewhat further, Bank credit expansion remained moderate in November, although business loans increased after 2 months of little or no growth.  On December 7 the Federal Reserve announced a reduction from 11 to 8 percent in marginal reserve requirements",,

With Messrs, Hayes and Francis dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for  the System Account in accordance with the following domestic  policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that growth in real output of goods and services was slow in the fourth quarter of 1973, in part because of the fuel situation, Prices continued to rise sharply in December, reflecting additional increases for petroleum products and widespread advances among other goods and services. A further weakening in activity and sharp rise in prices appear to be in prospect for early 1974. In December nonfarm payroll employment changed little and the unemployment rate increased further. Wage rates have continued to rise substantially in recent months, although not so sharply as prices,  Major foreign currencies have depreciated further against the dollar since mid-December, and some foreign monetary authorities have continued to sell dollars in exchange markets. Steep price increases imposed by oil-producing countries have heightened fears of economic disruption in many countries and of large and erratic international flows of funds.  The narrowly defined money stock increased substantially in the last 2 months of 1973, partly reflecting increased foreign deposits, but it has changed little on balance over recent weeks. Net inflows of consumer-type time deposits remained sizable at both banks and nonbank thrift institutions. Bank credit expansion, which was moderate over the closing months of 1973, has accelerated in recent weeks as banks have stepped up issuance of large-denomination CD's. Since mid-December, interest rate movements have been mixed; yields on most long-term securities and on Treasury bills have risen on balance, while some private short-term rates have declined,",,
19740122,"1/22/74 -6 in light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, cushioning the effects on production and employment growing out of the oil shortage, and maintaining equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing and of international and domestic financial market developments, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

After having appreciated for several months, the dollar has declined somewhat on the average against foreign currencies in recent weeks, U.S, controls on capital outflows were removed at the end of January, and several foreign countries have relaxed controls on capital inflows. The U.S. trade surplus rose sharply in December and in the fourth quarter as a whole,  The narrowly defined money stock, after increasing substantially in the last 2 months of 1973, declined in January; most recently, however, it has appeared to strengthen. Broader measures of the money stock continued to rise in January, as net inflows of consumer-type time deposits remained relatively strong. Expansion in business loans and in total bank credit accelerated, and banks stepped up issuance of large-denomination cD's, Since mid-January, short-term market interest rates have fallen appreciably, and long-term rates have declined somewhat.

The basic purposes of System operations in foreign currencies are:  A. To help safeguard the value of the dollar in international exchange markets;  B. To aid in making the system of international payments more efficient;  Cc. To further monetary cooperation with central banks of other countries having convertible currencies, with the International Monetary Fund, and with other international payments institutions 5  D. To help insure that market movements in exchange rates, within the limits stated in the International Monetary Fund Agreement or established by central bank practices, reflect the interaction cf underlying economic forces and thus serve as efficient guides to current financial decisions, private and public; and  E. To facilitate growth in international liquidity in accordance with the needs of an expanding world economy.  2, Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee, System operations in foreign currencies shall be undertaken only when necessary:  A. To cushion or moderate fluctuations in the flows of international payments, if such fluctuations (1) are deemed to reflect transitional market unsettlement or other temporary forces and therefore are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future; and (2) are deemed to be dis-equilibrating or otherwise to have potentially destabilizing effects on U.S. or foreign official reserves or on exchange markets, for example, by occasioning market anxieties, undesirable speculative activity, or excessive leads and Lags in international payments 5",,
19740319,"3/18-19/74 -15 B., To temper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates, and to moderate forward premiums and discounts judged to be dis-equilibrating. Whenever supply or demand persists in influencing exchange rates in one direction, System transactions should be modified or curtailed unless upon review and reassessment of the situation the Committee directs otherwise;  C. To aid in avoiding disorderly conditions in exchange markets, Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions. Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Special Manager reaches 4 judgment that they may help to reestablish supply and demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments. In such cases, the Special Manager shall consult as soon as practicable with the Committee or, in an emergency, with the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for foreign currency operations, and  D. To adjust System balances within the limits established in the Authorization for foreign currency operations in light of probable future needs for currencies,  3. System drawings under the swap arrangements are appropriate when necessary to obtain foreign currencies for the purposes stated in paragraph 2 above.  4. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, transactions in forward exchange, either outright or in conjunction with spot transactions, may be undertaken only (i} to prevent forward premiums or discounts from giving rise to dis-equilibrating movements of short-term funds; (1i) to minimize speculative disturbances; (iii) to supplement existing market supplies of forward cover, directly or indirectly, as a means of encouraging the retention or",,

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is declining in the current quarter, in large part because of the oil situation, and that prices are continuing to rise rapidly. In February industrial production and manufacturing employment declined again, while total nonfarm payroll employment recovered, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.2 percent. Prices of farm and food products and industrial commodities increased sharply, although less so than in the preceding 2 months. Increases in wage rates appear to have moderated in recent months,  After depreciating during the first 3 weeks of February, the dollar has since shown little net change against leading foreign currencies, The U.S, trade surplus remained large in January, despite a further sharp rise in the cost of petroleum imports.  The narrowly defined money stock, after having declined in January, increased sharply in February and early March, Broader measures of the money stock rose substantially in February, as net inflows of consumer-type time deposits remained relatively strong. Business short-term borrowing at banks and in the open market has continued at a rapid pace. Following earlier declines, both short- and long-term market interest rates have risen appreciably in recent weeks,",,

(3) Such Federal Reserve Bank may engage in operations of the types specified in the Committee's authorization for System foreign currency operations when requested to do so by an authorized official of the U.S. Treasury Department; provided, however, that such Bank shall take all steps practicable at the time to insure as far as possible that, in light of the information available on other System foreign currency operations, its own operations do not result in the aggregate in breaching any of the several dollar limits specified in the authorization,",,

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services declined appreciably in the first quarter and that price increases were exceptionally large. The decline in economic activity reflected mainly the impact of the oil shortage, which is being eased by the ending of the oil embargo. In March industrial production and manufacturing employment receded further, but retail sales strengthened, The unemployment rate changed little, remaining slightly above 5 percent. Prices of farm and food products declined in March, but increases among industrial commodities were widespread and extraordinarily large. Advances in wage rates were moderate in the first quarter.  in March the dollar depreciated further against Leading foreign currencies, and the balance of payments was in deficit on the official settlements basis.

Wholesale prices of farm and food products declined substantially further, but increases among industrial commodities again were widespread and extraordinarily large, The advance in wage rates has accelerated somewhat in recent months, and unit labor costs have been rising at a fast pace,  In April and early May the dollar depreciated further against leading foreign currencies, and the balance of payments remained in deficit on the official settlements basis, Rising import costs for petroleum and other products contributed to a sizable deficit in U.S. foreign trade in March,  Growth in the narrowly defined money stock slackened somewhat in April from the rapid pace in the preceding 2 months, and the more broadly defined money stock continued to expand moderately, Deposit experience at nonbank thrift institutions deteriorated sharply. Business short-term credit demands remained exceptionally strong, These demands were concentrated in banks, and to help finance loan growth, banks issued a record amount of large-denomination CD's and continued to borrow in the commercial paper and Eurodollar markets.

19740820,"8/20/74 -4  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is changing little in the current quarter, following the first-half decline, and that price and wage increases are continuing large. In July industrial production was unchanged from the May-June level, and nonfarm payroll employment declined further. The unemployment rate edged up to 5.3 percent. Wholesale prices of farm and food products rose sharply, after having declined for 4 months, and increases among industrial commodities continued widespread and extraordinarily large.  The new Administration has indicated that it will give high priority to combating inflation and that it will convene a summit meeting of the nation's economic leaders to that end,  In recent weeks the dollar has appreciated somewhat further against leading foreign currencies, U.S. bank lending to foreign borrowers, especially in Japan, has apparently continued large, but inflows of foreign capital, particularly from oil-exporting countries, have also been large, The foreign trade deficit, although smaller in June than in May, widened substantially from the first to the second quarter as the value of petroleum imports increased.  The narrowly defined money stock rose only slightly in July, after having grown at an annual rate of 6 percent over the first half of the year. Net inflows at banks of time deposits other than money market CD's slowed somewhat in July, and deposit experience at nonbank institutions worsened materially in July and early August.",,
19740820,"8/20/74 -5 Growth in business loans and in total bank credit was substantial in July, although the pace of expansion slackened after the early part of the month, To finance loan growth, banks reduced their holdings of Treasury securities and increased their outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's by substantial amounts. Interest rates on most private market instruments have declined  a little in recent weeks, and in association with some easing of tensions in financial markets, yield spreads between prime- and lower-quality issues--which had widened sharply--have narrowed. Yields on Government securities, particularly Treasury bills, have increased, in part because new Treasury offerings relieved a market shortage of such securities.

U.S. bank lending to foreign borrowers diminished in July and apparently also in August, while inflows from abroad increased, The foreign trade deficit, which had narrowed in June, widened in July,  In August growth of the narrowly defined money stock was above the low pace of July but well below the 6 percent annual rate of the first half of the year, Net inflows of time deposits other than money market CD's continued at about the July rate, but the performance of passbook savings at banks--and of total deposits at nonbank thrift institutions-remained weak, Although growth in business loans remained relatively strong in August, growth in total bank credit was moderate, and banks reduced their reliance on large-denomination CD's and nondeposit funds. Interest rates on most short term market instruments have changed little on balance since mid-August, while rates on most types of longer-term securities have risen further. On September 4 the Federal Reserve announced the removal of the 3 percent marginal reserve requirement on longer-term, large-denomination CD's,  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, supporting a resumption of real economic growth, and achieving equilibrium in the country's balance of payments,  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead,  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would  be on October 15, 1974, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned,",,

In September industrial production increased somewhat, reflecting settlement of work stoppages that had reduced output in August, An upsurge in the labor force, following several months of relatively slow growth, raised the unemployment rate from 5,4 to 5.8 percent, The rise in wholesale prices of industrial commodities moderated, although it remained substantial, and prices of farm products and foods declined after having increased sharply in July and August.  On October 8 the President recommended a program to combat inflation and to mitigate the impact of monetary and fiscal restraint on certain sectors of the economy. The tax and expenditure proposals included in the program would, on balance, have approximately a neutral effect on the size of the Federal deficit,  In recent weeks the dollar has declined against leading foreign currencies.

The money supply measure more broadly defined to include bank time and savings deposits other than money market CD's--as well as the measure that includes deposits at other thrift institutions--also rose only slightly in September, Over-all business credit demands slackened last month, and outstanding business loans at banks leveled off, Since early September interest rates on short-term market instruments have fallen considerably, while yields on Treasury and State and local government bonds have declined modestly. Yields on corporate bonds have risen somewhat further, on balance, reflecting the large volume of offerings in prospect,  In light cf the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to resisting inflationary pressures, supporting a resumption of real economic growth, and achieving equilibrium in the country's balance of payments,  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing and of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent  with resumption of moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

The October rise in wholesale prices of industrial commodities, although substantial, remained well below the extraordinarily vapid rate in the first 8 months of the year; prices of farm products and foods increased sharply.  In recent weeks the dollar has declined further against leading foreign currencies, In the third quarter the U.S. foreign trade deficit was substantially larger than in the second quarter, but U.S, banks sharply reduced their foreign lending.  Growth of the narrowly defined money stock picked up from the slow pace of the third quarter to an annual rate of about 5 percent in October, Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks and at nonbank thrift institutions also improved in October, and the money supply measures more broadly defined expanded appreciably. Bank credit outstanding changed little, and banks reduced their borrowing through Euro-dollars and Large-denomination CD's. Since mid-October markets for short- and long-term securities have improved, despite heavy Treasury financing and a large volume of corporate security issues, Interest rates on market securities in general have declined further, and mortgage yields also have fallen somewhat, On November 13 the Board of Governors announced a restructuring of member bank reserve requirements, which will have the effect cf releasing reserves to the banking system in the week beginning December 12.

Jn December and early January, however, the narrowly defined money stock changed little. Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks slowed sharply in December, although they continued to improve at nonbank thrift institutions; in early January deposit inflows at banks picked up. Business demands for short-term credit, both at banks and in the commercial paper market, moderated further in December, while demands in the long-term market remained strong.

Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions, Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to reestablish supply and demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments. In such cases, the Manager shall consult as soon as practicable with the Committee or, in an emergency, with the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations.

With this amendment, paragraph 2 reads as follows:  The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or, under special circumstances, such as when the New York Reserve Bank is closed, any other Federal Reserve Bank, to purchase directly from the Treasury for its own account (with discretion, in cases where it seems desirable, to issue participations to one or more Federal Reserve Banks) such amounts of special short-term certificates of indebtedness as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation cf the Treasury; provided that the rate charged on such certificates shall be a rate of 1/4 of 1 percent below the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of such purchases, and provided further that the total amount of such certificates held at any one time by the Federal Reserve Banks shall not exceed $1 billion.  By unanimous vote, Section 270.4(d) of the Regulation Relating toe Open Market Operations of Federal Reserve Banks was amended, effective January 30, 1975, by striking the word ""if"" in  the clause ""  or, if that Bank is closed,"" and inserting in its place the words “under special circumstances, such as when....""

By unanimous vote, the action of members of the Federal Open Market Committee on February 18, 1975, incorporating a fee schedule as subsection 271.4(f) in the Committee's amended Rules Regarding the Availability of Information, was ratified.

19750219,"2/19/75 -7 The memorandum of discussion for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on January 20-21, 1975, was accepted.

By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period January 21 through February 18, 1975, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  Mr. Sheehan left the meeting prior to the following action.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is continuing to fall sharply in the current quarter. In January declines in industrial production and employment were large and widespread for the third consecutive month. The unemployment rate rose a full percentage point to 8.2 percent, Average wholesale prices of industrial commodities, which were unchanged in December, rose moderately in January, and prices of farm and food products declined further. In recent months increases in average wage rates have moderated, although they have still been large.  The decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar was arrested in early February by concerted central  bank intervention and a sharp decline in European interest rates, but in recent days the dollar has declined somewhat.",,
19750219,"2/19/75 -8 In December the U S. foreign trade deficit increased, but it was smaller in the fourth quarter as a whole than in the third.  The narrowly defined money stock, after having grown at an annual rate of about 4-1/2 percent over the fourth quarter of 1974, declined sharply in January. However, net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits at banks and nonbank thrift institutions were large, and broader measures of the money stock continued to expand, Business demands for short-term credit have weakened in recent months, both at banks and in the commercial paper market, while demands in the long-term market have been exceptionally strong. Since mid-January short-term market interest rates have fallen substantially further, and yields on long-term securities also have declined, Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced from 7-1/4 to 6-3/4 percent in early February.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to cushioning recessionary tendencies and stimulating economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and working toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than has occurred in recent months.

The advance in average wage rates, although large, remained well below the increases of last spring and summer,  The foreign exchange value of the dollar declined in February, but it strengthened somewhat in early March, as short-term interest rates abroad fell further and as market attitudes toward the dollar improved somewhat. In January the U.S. foreign trade deficit was only moderately above the rate in the fourth quarter of 1974 despite a large bulge in recorded imports of oil. Net outflows of capital reported by banks continued large as foreigners withdrew deposits.  The narrowly defined money stock, which had declined sharply in January, expanded considerably in February, and broader measures of the money stock grew at substantial rates. Net inflows of consumer-type time and savings deposits were particularly large, Large-denomination CD's outstanding contracted in February and total bank credit showed little net change. Business demands for short-term credit remained weak, both at banks and in the commercial paper market, while demands in the longterm market continued exceptionally strong. Since midFebruary short-term market interest rates have declined a little while longer-term yields have risen, Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced from 6-3/4 to 6-1/4 percent in early March,  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to stimulating economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and working toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments,  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than has occurred in recent months.",,

All actions taken by the Subcommittee under this paragraph shall be reported promptly to the Committee.  7. The Chairman (and in his absence the Vice Chairman of the Committee, and in the absence of both, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors) is authorized:  A, With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the Secretary;  B.

19750318,"3/18/75 -15 By unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive shown  below was reaffirmed: FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE  1. The basic purposes of System operations in foreign currencies are:  A, To help safeguard the value of the dollar in international exchange markets;  B. ‘To aid in making the system of international payments more efficient;  c. To further monetary cooperation with central banks of other countries having convertible currencies, with the International Monetary Fund, and with other international payments institutions ;  D. To help insure that market movements in exchange rates, within the limits stated in the International Monetary Fund Agreement or established by central bank practices, reflect the interaction of underlying economic forces and thus serve as efficient guides to current financial decisions, private and public; and  E. To facilitate growth in international liquidity in accordance with the needs of an expanding world economy.  2. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee, System operations in foreign currencies shall be undertaken only when necessary:  A. To cushion or moderate fluctuations in the flows of international payments, if such fluctuations (1) are deemed to reflect transitional market unsettlement or other temporary forces and therefore are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future; and (2) are deemed to be dis-equilibrating or otherwise to have potentially destabilizing effects on U.S. or foreign official reserves or on exchange markets, for example, by occasioning market anxieties, undesirable speculative activity, or excessive leads and lags in international payments ;",,
19750318,"3/18/75 -16 B. To temper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates, and to moderate forward premiums and discounts judged to be dis-equilibrating. Whenever supply or demand persists in influencing exchange rates in one direction, System transactions should be modified or curtailed unless upon review and reassessment of the situation the Committee directs otherwise ;  C. To aid in avoiding disorderly conditions in exchange markets, Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and (3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions, Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to reestablish supply and demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments, In such cases, the Manager shall consult as soon as practicable with the Committee or, in an emergency, with the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations; and  D. To adjust System balances within the limits established in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations in light of probable future needs for currencies.  3. System drawings under the swap arrangements are appropriate when necessary to obtain foreign currencies for the purposes stated in paragraph 2 above.  4, Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, transactions in forward exchange, either outright or in conjunction with spot transactions, may be undertaken only (i) to prevent forward premiums or discounts from giving rise to dis-equilibrating movements of short-term funds; (ii) to minimize speculative disturbances; (iii) to supplement existing market supplies of forward cover, directly or indirectly as a means of encouraging the retention or accumulation of dollar holdings by private foreign holders; (iv) to allow",,
19750318,"3/18/75 -17 greater flexibility in covering System or Treasury commitments, including commitments under swap arrangements, and to facilitate operations of the Stabilization Fund; (v) to facilitate the use of one currency [for the settlement of System or Treasury commitments denominated in other currencies; and (vi) to provide cover for System holdings of foreign currencies.

By unanimous vote, renewal for further periods of 3 months of System drawings on the National Bank of Belgium, the Swiss National Bank, and the Bank for International Settlements, maturing in the period May 5 through 1h, 1975, was authorized.  By unanimous vote, the System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances, during the period March 18 through April 14, 1975, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  Mr. Bucher left the meeting prior to the following action.  With Mr. Eastburn dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests  that real output of goods and services fell sharply in the first quarter. However, retail sales strengthened during the quarter, and the rate of decline in over-all activity has slowed in recent weeks, In March industrial production and employment declined less than they had on average in the preceding 4 months, but the unemployment  rate increased from 8, 2 to 8.7 percent, as the civilian labor force grew, Average wholesale prices of industrial",,
19750415,"4/14-15/75 -4 commodities rose little in March and prices of farm and food products declined sharply. The advance in average wage rates during the first quarter was large, but it  was still below the increases of last spring and summer,  The prospect of an upturn in economic activity has been strengthened by enactment of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, which will be adding soon to growth in disposable personal income.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar has risen since early March, as short-term interest rates abroad have declined further and market attitudes toward the dollar have continued to improve. In January-February the U.S, foreign trade balance was in surplus, as agricultural exports reached a new high and the volume of imports other than fuels declined, Net outflows of funds through banks continued large in February but appear to have diminished in March. In early April reserve requirements on foreign borrowings by member banks were reduced from 8 to 4 percent.  The narrowly defined money stock rose moderately on balance over the first quarter, while broader measures of the money stock expanded more rapidly, Growth was substantial in March, apparently in part because of the effects of accelerated tax refunds on deposits at banks and nonbank thrift institutions. Business demands for short-term credit remained weak, both at banks and in the commercial paper market, while demands in the long-term market continued exceptionally strong, Since mid-March short-term market interest rates have increased somewhat and longer-term yields have risen considerably further,  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to stimulating economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and working toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments,",,
19750415,"4/14-15/75 56  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing and of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with somewhat more rapid growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead than has occurred on average in recent months,  It was agreed that the authorization for the lending of Government securities from the System Open Market Account, contained in paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, should be retained at this time, subject to annual review.  By unanimous vote, the Committee approved the changes in the terms and conditions for lending securities from the System Open Market Account recommended by the Manager in a memorandum dated March 7, 1975.

19750520,"5/20/75 -3 Secretary's Note: On June 3, 1975, the following letter was sent to Congressman Patman over the signature of Chairman Burns:  Dear Mr. Chairman:  Your request for the memoranda of discussion for meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (""FOMC"") in the years 1971-74, inclusive, has been considered carefully by the Committee, In this connection, the FOMC has given full and deliberate consideration to the oversight responsibility that the Congress in general and your Subcommittee in particular have with respect to its functions and operations.  I might note at the outset that, apart from the memoranda which you request, there are three regularly available sources of information about the operations of the FOMC. One consists of weekly statistical releases published by the Board, which promptly and fully disclose the results of the Committee's open market operations. The most important of such weekly releases are the Federal Reserve Statement (H.4.1), the Weekly Summary of Banking and Credit Measures (H.9), and Money Stock Measures (H.6).  A second source is the record of policy actions, which is prepared pursuant to a requirement of the Federal Reserve Act. These policy records disclose the Committee's intentions with respect to open market policy, as reflected in the actions reported, They include all votes, by name, cast by members of the Committee in connection with the determination of open market policies; the reasons underlying the policy actions, including descriptions of then-current and prospective economic developments and of conditions in domestic and international financial markets; and statements of the reasons for any dissenting votes.  A third source, the minutes of actions, indicates all votes taken by the FOMC--including those relating to procedural matters as well as those relating to policy questions, The minute entries for policy actions are made available for public inspection on the same schedule as the policy records; the minute entries for most other actions are made available promptly after the meeting.",,
19750520,"5/20/75 -4 To this copious body of information concerning the operations of the FOMC, the memoranda of discussion add essentially one further type of material: reports of the deliberations through which the Committee reaches its decisions on policy and procedural matters, As you are aware, there is no legal requirement that such memoranda of FOMC meetings be prepared, However, they have proved valuable to the POMC and its staff in connection with the ongoing work of the Committee, and we believe they constitute a useful historical record. For these reasons, they are maintained by the Committee and made available to the public after a time lag determined by the FOMC,  The memoranda of discussion reflect the unfettered, spontaneous expressions of FOMC member views and opinions. Some of these expressions may be put forth primarily to elicit discussion and clarification of issues rather than as statements of firmly held views, Some may turn out to be inconclusive with respect to the FOMC's ultimate decisions, and others at odds with those decisions, All such expressions do, however, contribute to the decisional process,  The informal ""give and take"" debate at FOMC meetings, as substantially reflected in the memoranda of discussion, involves the decision-making process utilized by the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of our Government since the founding of the Republic. Each branch of Government daily encounters the situation where individual opinions and advice, expressed and conveyed in the decision-making process, are re-thought, altered, or reversed on the hearing of opinions and views cf other participants, Premature public exposure of such deliberations, whether involving legislative, executive, judicial, or administrative bodies, preceding as they do the official decisions and actions of such bodies, would quickly and certainly make such decisional process sterile. If the FOMC memoranda of discussion were to be released prematurely, the Committee would be faced with the choice of permitting a destructive diminution of candor in its deliberations or of preserving the members' ability to speak their minds freely and fully by terminating the preparation of such memoranda. Neither alternative would be in the public interest.",,
19750520,"5/20/75 -5 In addition, the matters commonly discussed at FOMC meetings include ongoing or prospective transactions in foreign exchange markets, the premature disclosure of which could have both immediate and longer-term adverse impact on international flows of funds, Moreover, references are frequently made to highly sensitive matters involving, or statements by or about, foreign central banks and governments, Clearly, continued FOMC access to such important and relevant communications must net be jeopardized by even a suggestion of untimely dissemination,  in view of these considerations, the Committee has concluded that it must respectfully decline to comply with your request for the 1971-74 memoranda of discussion,  The Committee's decision, premised in major part on its need to preserve the practice of free and uninhibited member contribution to discussions, reflects a legal position the concept of which was reaffirmed by the United States Supreme Court as recently as one month ago in the case of NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck, & Co., 95 S Cr. 1504, 1516 (1975). Justice White, speaking for the Court with respect to the need to protect the decision-making processes of government agencies, cited the Court's earlier position that ""..,experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances...to the detriment of the decision-making process.""  As Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee I endorse whole-heartedly the foregoing principle.  Mr. Rippey left and staff members who were not present at the outset entered the meeting prior to the following actions.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the action taken by members on April 17, 1975, revising the procedures for allocation of securities in the System Open Market Account to read as follows,  effective May 1, 1975:",,
19750520,"5/20/75 -6 1, Securities in the System Open Market Account shall be reallocated at least once each year as determined by the Board's Division of Federal Reserve Bank Operations and the Manager of the System Open Market Account for the purpose of settling Inter district clearings and approximately equalizing for each Federal Reserve Bank the ratio of gold certificate holdings to Federal Reserve notes outstanding,  2. Until the next reallocation, the Account shall be apportioned on the basis of the ratios determined in Paragraph 1,  3. Profits and losses on the sale of securities from the account shall be allocated on the day of delivery of the securities sold on the basis of each Bank's current holdings at the opening of business on that day.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the action taken by members on April 30, 1975, increasing from $3 billion to $4 billion the limit specified in paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations on changes between meetings in System Account holdings of U.S. Government and Federal agency securities, effective April 30, 1975, through the close of business May 20, 1975.  By unanimous vote, the Committee decided to maintain the dollar limit specified in paragraph 1{a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations at $4 billion for the period through the close of business June 17, 1975.

By unanimous vote, the open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period April 15 through May 19, 1975, were approved, ratified, and confirmed.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests  that real output of goods and services--after having fallen sharply for two quarters--is declining much less rapidly in the current quarter. In April the pace of the decline in industrial production moderated considerably further, and total employment rose. However,  the unemployment rate increased again, from 8.7 to 8.9 percent, as the civilian labor force increased considerably, Average wholesale prices of industrial commodities changed little in April, as in March; prices of farm and food products rose sharply, following several months of large decreases. The advance in average wage rates  so far this year has been considerably less rapid than the increase during the second half of 1974,",,
19750520,"5/20/75 -B The foreign exchange value of the dollar has declined somewhat since mid-April, but it is still above the low of early March. U.S. imports fell sharply in the first quarter, and the foreign trade balance was in substantial surplus, in contrast to the deficits of preceding quarters, Net outflows of funds through banks were large in the first quarter, as loans to foreigners continued to increase while liabilities to foreigners declined,  Both M, and grew moderately in April, but M. grew more rapidly as inflows of deposits to nonbank thrift institutions remained substantial. Business demands for short-term credit remained weak, both at banks and in the commercial paper market, while demands in the long-term market continued strong. Since midApril short-term market interest rates have declined somewhat, Most longer-term yields have changed little on balance, and mortgage rates have risen. Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced from 6-1/4 to 6 percent in mid-May.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to stimulating economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and working toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions over the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates generally appear to be growing within currently acceptable short ranges of tolerance.

Industrial production declined slightly further, but total employment advanced for the second consecutive month. ‘The unemployment rate increased again, from 8.9 to 9.2 percent, as the civilian labor force rose substantially further. ‘The rise in average wholesale prices of industrial commodities continued to be slow; prices of farm and food products increased moderately further. The advance in average wage rates so far this year has been considerably less rapid than the increase during the second half of 1974.

Business demands for short-term credit both at banks  and  in the commercial paper market remained unusually  weak, while demands in the long-term market continued very strong, Market interest rates in general changed Little during the latter part of May, but since then rates in longer-term markets and on Treasury bills have declined. Mortgage rates have eased over the past month.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the  policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to stimulating economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and working toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments,  To implement this policy, while taking account of  developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve  and  money market conditions consistent with moderate  growth in monetary aggregates over the months ahead.  for the  amended  5.

With Mr. Holland dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services leveled off in the second quarter of the year, as consumer spending continued to strengthen, Activity in residential real estate markets has picked up in recent months, In June industrial production rose slightly, following 8 months of decline. The calculated unemployment rate declined substantially, but this was attributed mainly to problems of seasonal adjustment, Average wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose somewhat more in June than in the preceding 3 months, chiefly because of increases in prices of petroleum products, but prices of farm and food products declined appreciably. From the first to the second quarter of the year, the advance in average wage rates continued to moderate.  In recent weeks the average exchange value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has risen considerably, as interest rates on U.S. dollar assets increased relative to rates on foreign currency assets after mid-June, In May the U.S. foreign trade balance",,
19750715,"7/15/75 4a  registered a substantial surplus, as imports dropped mote sharply than exports. U.S. banks reported a sizable increase in claims on foreigners, while liabilities to foreigners were reduced slightly.  Growth in M1, M2, and M3—which was substantial in May--was extremely rapid in June, in part because of Federal income tax rebates and of supplementary social security payments; beginning late in the month, after completion of such payments, the aggregates weakened. Business demands for short-term credit remained unusually weak both at banks and in the commercial paper market, while demands in the longterm market continued exceptionally strong. Market interest rates in general have risen appreciably in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions conducive to stimulating economic recovery, while resisting inflationary pressures and working toward equilibrium in the country's balance of payments,  To implement this policy, while taking account of the forthcoming Treasury financing and of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing bank reserve and money market conditions over the period immediately ahead, provided that growth in monetary aggregates appears to be slowing substantially from the bulge during the second quarter.

Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand in September, and the unemployment rate edged down from 8.4 to 8.3 percent. In September, as in August, average wholesale prices of industrial commodities rose somewhat faster than earlier in the year, in part because of increases in prices of energy products; prices of farm and food products rose sharply in September. The advance in average wage rates in recent months has remained somewhat less rapid than in 1974 and early 1975.  After rising further in late September, the exchange value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has declined to about its mid-September level. In August the U.S. foreign trade surplus increased as agricultural exports rose, Bank-reported private capital movements showed a further net inflow, while U.8. liabilities to foreign official agencies declined again.  M3, rose slightly on the average in September but declined in the latter part of the month and in early October. From the second to the third quarter, however, M, grew at a 6.9 percent annual rate.

19760316,"3/15-16/76 -14 By unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive shown below was reaffirmed: FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE  1. The basic purposes of System operations in foreign currencies are:  A. To help safeguard the value of the dollar in international exchange markets;  B. To aid in making the system of international payments more efficient;  C. To further monetary cooperation with central banks of other countries having convertible currencies, with the International Monetary Fund, and with other international payments institutions;  D. To help insure that market movements in exchange “pates, within the limits stated in the International Monetary Fund Agreement or established by central bank practices, reflect the interaction of underlying economic forces and thus serve as efficient guides to current ‘financial decisions, private and public; and  E, To facilitate growth in international liquidity in accordance with the needs of an expanding world economy.  2. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee, System operations in foreign currencies shall be undertaken only when necessary:  A. To cushion or moderate fluctuations in the flows of international payments, if such fluctuations (1) are deemed to reflect transitional market unsettlement or other temporary forces and therefore are expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future; and (2) are deemed to be dis-equilibrating or otherwise to have potentially destabilizing effects on U.S. or foreign official reserves or on exchange markets, for example, by occasioning market anxieties, undesirable speculative activity, or excessive leads and lags in international payments 5",,
19760316,"3/15-16/76 -15 B. To temper and smooth out abrupt changes in spot exchange rates, and to moderate forward premiums and discounts , judged to be dis-equilibrating. Whenever supply or demand persists in influencing exchange rates in one direction,  System transactions should be modified or curtailed unless upon review and reassessment of the situation the Committee directs otherwise;  C. To aid in avoiding disorderly conditions in exchange markets. Special factors that might make for exchange market instabilities include (1) responses to short-run increases in international political tension, (2) differences in phasing of international economic activity that give rise to unusually large interest rate differentials between major markets, and(3) market rumors of a character likely to stimulate speculative transactions, Whenever exchange market instability threatens to produce disorderly conditions, System transactions may be undertaken if the Manager reaches a judgment that they may help to reestablish supply and demand balance at a level more consistent with the prevailing flow of underlying payments, In such cases, the Manager shall consult as soon as practicable with.the Committee.or, in an emergency, with the members of the Subcommittee designated for that purpose in paragraph 6 of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations; and  D. To adjust System balances within the limits established in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations in light of probable future needs for currencies,  3. System drawings under the swap arrangements are appropriate when necessary to obtain foreign currencies for the purposes stated in paragraph 2 above,  4, Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, transactions in forward exchange, either outright or in conjunction with spot transactions, may be undertaken only (i) to prevent forward premiums or discounts from giving rise to dis-equilibrating movements of short-term funds; (ii) to _ minimize speculative disturbances; (iii) to supplement existing market supplies of forward cover, directly or indirectly as a means of encouraging the retention or accumulation of dollar holdings by private foreign holders; (iv) to allow",,
19760316,"3/15-16/76 -16 greater flexibility in covering System or Treasury commitments, including commitments under swap arrangements, and to facilitate operations of the Stabilization Fund; (v) to facilitate the use of one currency for the settlement of System or Treasury commitments denominated in other currencies; and (vi) to provide cover for System holdings of foreign currencies.

In April recovery in industrial production continued, and gains in employment were large and widespread. However, the civilian labor force also increased substantially, and the unemployment rate continued at 7.5 percent. Retail sales remained at the March level.

Over recent months, the index of average wage rates has advanced moderately.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has been relatively steady in recent weeks. During the first quarter, there was a sizable U.S. foreign trade deficit, in contrast to the large surpluses in the preceding four quarters.

In May retail sales declined from the March-April level and were near the monthly average of the first quarter. However, recovery in industrial production continued at about the average pace of the first 4 months of the year, and the gain in employment again was substantial. The unemployment rate declined from 7.5 to 7.3 percent. The rise in the wholesale price index for all commodities, which had been large in April, was moderate in May; average prices of farm products and foods rose much less than in April. Average prices of industrial commodities changed little in May, but in recent weeks price increases have been announced for some major industrial materials. The rise in consumer prices in May was somewhat faster than the average increase in earlier months of the year, owing to increases in prices of food and energy items. The advance in the index of average wage rates was larger in May than the gains in other recent months, owing in part to implementation of a new labor contract in a major industry.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has been relatively steady in recent weeks. On June 7 a total of $5.3 billion of 6-month stand-by credits to the United Kingdom was announced, including $1 billion under the Federal Reserve System's swap line and $1 billion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Subsequently, the decline in the pound sterling was halted and partly reversed. In April the U. S. foreign trade deficit was at the same rate as in the first quarter.  Growth in monetary aggregates slowed substantially in May and early June from the exceptionally rapid rates recorded in April, mainly because of a sharp slackening in expansion of demand deposits at commercial banks; inflows of those time and savings deposits included in the broader aggregates were relatively well maintained.",,
19760622,"6/22/76 -5 Market interest rates in general rose somewhat further in the latter part of May, but since then, short-term rates have fluctuated in a narrow range and long-term rates have edged down.

To implement this policy, while taking account of  developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.

With Mr. Volcker dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions for the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services, which had been vigorous in the first quarter, moderated in the second quarter as a consequence of a smaller advance in consumer spending and little change in the rate of inventory accumulation. In June growth in industrial production slowed and nonfarm payroll employment changed little. The unemployment rate edged up to 7,5 percent from 7.3 percent in May, but this increase may have partly reflected seasonal adjustment problems. Retail sales rebounded strongly in June. The rise in the wholesale price index for all commodities remained moderate, as the advance in average prices. of farm products and foods slowed further. However, average prices of industrial commodities rose more than in other recent months. The advance in. the index of average wage rates slowed considerably in June following a sharp rise in May; over the second quarter as a whole the index rose at about the same rate as in the first quarter.",,
19760720,"-he  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has remained relatively steady in recent weeks. In May there was a small surplus in the U.S. foreign trade balance,  M,, which had grown moderately in May, declined slightly in June. From the first to the second quarter, however, M3 expanded at an 8.4 percent annual rate because of the exceptional rise in April. Growth in Mp and My moderated in June, mainly because of the decline in M,, although inflows of the time and savings deposits included in the broader aggregates also slowed somewhat. Short-term market interest rates have declined somewhat in recent weeks, and most long-term rates have edged down.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  To implement this policy, while taking account of developments in domestic and international financial markets, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions consistent with moderate growth in monetary aggregates over the period ahead.

To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank  for International Settlements, and with other international financial institutions:  Austrian schillings Belgian francs Canadian dollars Danish kroner Pounds sterling French francs German marks Italian lire Japanese Yen Mexican pesos Netherlands guilders Norwegian kroner Swedish kronor Swiss francs",,

To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed  in paragraph 2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.  D. To maintain an over-all open position  in all foreign currencies not exceeding  $1. 0 billion, unless a larger position is expressly authorized by the Committee.

19761221,"12/20-21/76 - iil  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services in the fourth quarter has remained at about the reduced pace of the third quarter. In both October and November retail sales increased substantially. Industrial production rose appreciably in November--following 2 months of decline--in large part as a result of termination of strikes in two major industries, although advances in output were widespread among other industries. Employment in manufacturing also recovered from the effects of strikes. According to household survey data, the gain in total employment was large, but the unemployment rate increased from 7.9 to 8.1 percent as the civilian labor force--which had changed little over the preceding 3 months--increased considerably. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose as much in November as in October, reflecting another substantial increase in average prices of industrial commodities; average prices of farm products and foods changed little. The advance in the index of average wage rates over recent months has remained below the rapid rate of increase during 1975.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has declined slightly in recent weeks. The pound sterling and also the currencies associated in the European ''snake"" arrangement strengthened against the U. S. dollar, while the Canadian dollar depreciated sharply. In October the U. S. foreign trade deficit remained substantial.  M-1, which had expanded sharply in October, was unchanged in November. Although growth in M-2 and M-3 moderated, it remained substantial as inflows of the time and savings deposits included in these broader aggregates continued strong. Interest rates have declined appreciably in recent weeks. In late November Federal Reserve discount rates were reduced from 5-1/2 to 5-1/4 percent, and in mid-December member bank reserve requirements were lowered somewhat.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.",,

I understand that the recent modification in language in the FOMC guidelines did not change the authorization for such warehousing which has existed for a number of years.  Given our joint participation in the official sterling balances facility, and our sharing equally of the risks, I am sure you will agree that Treasury and the Federal Reserve will need to work out together any questions related to implementation of the Basle agreement. In this connection, it is my understanding, in the event the IMF Managing Director finds that the United Kingdom is not fulfilling the provisions of the agreement, that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury would jointly have to agree if U.

In December retail sales increased sharply, following strong gains in the preceding 2 months. Industrial production and total employment rose further, and the unemployment rate declined from 8.1 to 7.9 percent. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose substantially, reflecting a sharp increase in average prices of farm products and foods; the rise in  average prices of industrial commodities slowed, owing largely to declines in prices of fuels.

The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies declined in December but has since recovered somewhat. The pound  sterling strengthened following negotiation  of an IMF stand-by arrangement and of a medium term facility to offset reductions in official sterling balances. In November the U. S. foreign trade deficit increased, bringing the October-November average deficit to about the third-quarter rate.  M-1, which was unchanged in November, expanded appreciably in December; from the third to the fourth quarter growth in M-1 was moderate.

No. 94409, 90 Stat. 1241 (""Sunshine Act''), established for the purpose of providing the public with the ""fullest practicable information regarding the decision making processes of the Federal Government... while protecting the rights of individuals and the ability of the Government to carry out its responsibilities.""1/ The Sunshine Act applies only to those Federal agencies that are defined in Section 552(e) of Title 5 of the United States Code and ""headed. by a collegial body composed of two or more individual members, a majority of whom are appointed to such position by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and any subdivision thereof authorized to act on behalf of the agency. ""'2/  The Federal Open Market Committee ('FOMC"") is a separate and independent statutory body within the Federal Reserve System. In no respect is it an agent or ‘subdivision' of the Board. It was originally established by the Banking Act of 1933 and restructured in its present form by the Banking Act of 1935 and subsequent legislation in 1942 (generally see 12 U.S.C. §263(a)). The FOMC's membership is composed of the seven members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (""Board of Governors"") and five representatives of  i7 Government in the Sunshine Act, Pub. L. No. 94409, §2, 90 Stat. 1241 (1976).  2/ Government in the Sunshine Act, Pub. L. No. 94409, §3(a), 90 Stat. 1241 (1976).",,
19770215,"2/15/77 --4 the Federal Reserve Banks who are selected annually in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 12A of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. §263(a). Members of the Board of Governors serve in an ex officio capacity on the FOMC by reason of their appointment as Members of the Board of Governors, not as a result of an appointment ""to such position"" (the FOMC) by the President. Representatives of the Reserve Banks serve on the FOMC not as a result of an appointment ""to such position"" by the President, but rather by virtue  of their positions with the Reserve Banks and their selection pursuant to Section 12A of the Federal Reserve Act. It is clear therefore that the FOMC does not fall within the scope of an ‘agency' or ‘subdivision’ as defined in the Sunshine Act and consequently is not subject to the provisions of that Act.  As explained below, the Act would not require the FOMC to hold its meetings in open session even if the FOMC were covered by the Act. However, despite the conclusion reached that the Sunshine Act does not apply to the FOMC, the FOMC has determined that its procedures and timing of public disclosure already are conducted in accordance with the spirit of the Sunshine Act, as that Act would apply to deliberations of the nature engaged in by the FOMC.  In the foregoing regard, the FOMC has noted that while the Act calls generally for open meetings of multi-member Federal agencies, 10 specific exemptions from the open meeting requirement are provided to assure the ability of the Government to carry out its responsibilities. Among the exemptions provided is that which authorizes any agency operating under the Act to conduct closed meetings where the subject of a meeting involves information ""the premature disclosure of which would--in the case of an agency which regulates currencies, securities, commodities, or financial institutions,",,
19770215,"2/15/77 -5 be likely to lead to significant financial speculation in currencies, securities, or commodities.""3/  As to meetings closed under such exemption, the Act requires the maintenance of either a transcript, electronic recording or minutes and sets forth specified, detailed requirements as to the contents and timing of disclosure of certain portions or all of such minutes. The Act permits the withholding from the public of the minutes where disclosure would be likely to produce adverse consequences of the nature described in the relevant exemptions.  The FOMC has reviewed the agenda of its monthly meetings for the past three years and has determined that all such meetings could have been closed pursuant to the exemption dealing with financial speculation or other exemptions set forth in the Sunshine Act. The FOMC has further determined that virtually all of its substantive deliberations could have been preserved pursuant to the Act's minutes requirements and that such minutes could similarly have been protected against premature disclosure under the provisions of the Act.  The FOMC's deliberations are currently reported by means of a document entitled ""Record of Policy Actions"" which is released to the public approximately one month after the meeting to which it relates. The Record of Policy Actions complies with the Act's minutes requirements in that it contains a full and accurate report of all matters of policy discussed and views presented, clearly sets forth all policy actions taken by the FOMC and the reasons therefor, and includes the votes by individual members on each policy action. The timing of release of the Record of Policy Actions is fully consistent with the Act's provisions assuring against premature release of any item of discussion in an agency's minutes that contains information of a sensitive financial nature. In fact, by  3/ Government in the Sunshine Act, Pub. L. No. 94409, §3(a), 90 Stat. 1242 (1976).",,
19770215,"2/15/77 -6 releasing the comprehensive Record of Policy Actions to the public approximately a month after each meeting, the FOMC exceeds the publication requirements that would be mandated by the letter of the Sunshine Act.  Recognizing the Congressional purpose underlying enactment of the Sunshine Act, the FOMC has determined to continue its current practice and timing of public disclosures in the conviction that its operations thus conducted are consistent with the intent and spirit of the Sunshine Act.

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting  suggests underlying strength in economic activity, although industrial production and retail sales were held down in January by the effects of unusually severe weather. Housing starts rose sharply in December, and labor market surveys completed by mid-January indicated a further rise in employment and a decline in the unemployment  rate from 7.8 to 7.3 percent. The wholesale price index for all commodities continued to",,
19770215,"2/15/77 - 8 rise, reflecting increases in the average both for farm products and foods and for industrial commodities. The index of average wage rates  rose sharply in January as a result of marked increases in the volatile construction and service sectors.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has risen somewhat over the past month. In December the U. S. foreign trade deficit increased further; in the fourth quarter as a whole the deficit was a little larger than in the third quarter.  M-1, which had expanded appreciably in December, grew at a moderate pace in January. Growth in M-2 and M-3 also moderated. At banks and thrift institutions, inflows of time and savings deposits other than large-denomination CD's slowed somewhat. Interest rates have changed relatively little on balance since mid-January.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on January 18, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, 7 to 10 percent, and 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 1976 to the fourth quarter of 1977 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it",,
19770215,"2/15/77 --9 expects the annual growth rates over the FebruaryMarch period to be within the ranges of 3 to 7 percent for M-1 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly average Federal funds rate of about 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 percent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 4-1/4 to 5 percent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  By unanimous vote, the Committee revised No. 4 of the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues to read as follows, effective immediately:  4. Purchases will be limited to fully taxable issues, not eligible for purchase by the Federal Financing Bank, for which there is an active secondary market. Purchases will also be limited to issues outstanding in amounts of $300 million or over in cases where the obligations have a maturity of five years or less at the time of issuance, and to issues outstanding in amounts of $200 million or over in cases where the securities have a maturity of more than five years at the time of issuance.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on March 15, 1977, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary",,

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods  and services has increased in the current  quarter from the reduced pace in the fourth  quarter of 1976. In February industrial  output and retail sales expanded substantially  after being held down for a time by the effects  of unusually severe weather. Employment rose considerably further; the unemployment rate",,
19770315,"3/15/77  ---6 increased somewhat to 7.5 percent--as the labor force more than recovered the decline of January--but it remained below the 7.8 percent of December. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose substantially in February, reflecting large increases  for farm products and foods and for fuels and power. The index of average wage rates rose more moderately over the first 2 months of 1977 than it had on the average during 1976.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has changed little over the past month. In January the U. 8S. foreign trade deficit increased further; exports were down a little from the fourth quarter rate and imports were substantially higher.  Growth in M-1 slowed sharply in February from the moderate pace in January. At banks and thrift institutions, inflows of time and savings deposits other than large denomination CD's continued to slacken. Business demands for short-term credit appear to have strengthened further in early 1977. Since mid February short-term market interest rates have changed little on balance, but most longer-term rates have edged higher.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on January 18, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent,  7 to 10 percent, and 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 1976 to the fourth quarter of 1977 appears to  be consistent with these objectives.",,
19770315,"3/15/77 -7 These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the March-April period to be within the ranges of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M-1 and 7 to 11 percent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly average Federal funds rate of about 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 percent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the mid-points of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  Consideration was then given to the continuing authorizations of the Committee, in accordance with the customary practice of reviewing such matters at the first meeting in March of every year.  Secretary's note: On February 25, 1977,  certain continuing authorizations of the  Committee, listed below, had been distributed  by the Secretary with the advice that, in accordance with procedures approved by the",,
19770315,"3/15/77 -8 Committee, they were being called to the Committee's attention before the March organization meeting to give members an opportunity to raise any questions they  had concerning them. Members were asked  to so indicate if they wished to have any of the authorizations in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this meeting, and no such requests were received.  The authorizations in question were as follows:  1. Procedures for allocation of securities in the System Open Market Account.  2. List of Treasury Department officials to whom weekly reports on open market operations may be sent.  3. Authority for the Chairman to appoint a Federal Reserve Bank as agent to operate the System Account in case the New York Bank is unable to function.  4.

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services increased in the first quarter from the reduced pace in the fourth quarter of 1976. In March industrial output, retail sales, and employment expanded substantially further. Although the labor force also increased sharply, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5 to 7.3 percent. The wholesale price index for all commodities again rose substantially; increases were particularly sharp among farm products and foods, and there were sizable advances for many industrial commodities. The index of average wage rates rose in the first quarter of 1977 at a somewhat faster pace than it had on the average during 1976, reflecting largely an increase in the minimum wage.  The average value of the dollar against leading foreign currencies has declined somewhat over the past month, returning to about the level at the beginning of the year.

At banks and thrift institutions, inflows of time and savings deposits other than large denomination CD's continued to slacken in March. Market interest rates declined considerably in mid-April, after having changed little since mid-March.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion, while resisting inflationary pressures and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  Growth in M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, 7 to 9-1/2 percent, and 8-1/2 to 11 percent, respectively, from the first quarter of 1977 to the first quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the April-May period to be within the ranges of 6 to 10 percent for M-1 and 8 to 12 percent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly average Federal funds rate of about 4-3/4 percent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the",,

Inflows of the time and savings deposits included in the broader aggregates were slower than earlier in the year, but because of the rapid expansion in M-1, growth in M--2 and M-3 accelerated.

Employment increased moderately but the labor force rose more and the unemployment rate edged up to 7.1 percent, the same as in June. The dollar value of total retail sales, which had turned up in July, rose appreciably in August. The wholesale price index for all commodities was about unchanged; average prices of farm products and foods declined sharply for the third successive month, and average prices of industrial commodities continued to rise at a more moderate pace than in the early months of 1977. So far this year the index of average hourly earnings has advanced at about the same pace as it had on the average during 1976.  The weighted average exchange rate for the dollar against leading foreign currencies has recovered further in recent weeks, returning to the level of late June. In July the U. S. foreign trade deficit was at about the second-quarter rate, and there were sizable net inflows of foreign private and official capital.",,
19770920,"9/20/77 -4 Growth in M-1 and M-2 slowed in August from the exceptionally rapid rates in July. Expansion of both demand deposits and time and savings deposits at banks slackened. Growth in M-3 also slowed, although inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained strong. Business short-term borrowing increased somewhat from the reduced pace in July, but remained below the volume of preceding months. Short-term interest rates, which had risen appreciably in early August, most recently have advanced somewhat further. Yields on longer-term market securities, however, have changed little on balance in recent months. Federal Reserve discount rates were increased from 5-1/4 to 5-3/4 percent in late August and early September, and member bank borrowings receded from the high levels of the latter part of August.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on July 19, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 percent, 7 to 9-1/2 percent, and 8-1/2 to 11 percent, respectively, from the second quarter of 1977 to the second quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in M-1] and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the SeptemberOctober period to be within the ranges of 2 to 7 percent for M-1 and 4 to 8 percent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates",,
19770920,"9/20/77 -5 are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of about 6-1/4 percent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6 to 6-1/2 percent.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the ‘situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, October 18, 1977, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned. Secretary's Note:  On September 30, 1977, Committee members voted to increase from $2 billion to $3 billion the limit on Federal Reserve Bank holdings of special short-term certificates of indebtedness  purchased directly from the Treasury specified in paragraph 2 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, effective  immediately.

By unanimous vote, the Committee amended paragraph 2 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations to lower the dollar limit on Federal Reserve Bank holdings of special short-term certificates of indebtedness purchased directly from the Treasury from $3 billion to $2 billion, effective immediately.  With Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Committee adopted the following ranges for rates of growth in monetary aggregates for the period from the third quarter of 1977 to the third quarter of 1978: M-1, 4 to 6-1/2 percent; M-2, 6-1/2 to 9 percent; and M-3, 8 to 10-1/2 percent.  With Mr. Morris dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy  directive:",,
19771018,"10/17-18/77 -4 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods and services slowed in the third quarter, mainly because of a reduction in the rate of inventory accumulation. In September industrial production expanded, returning to about the level reached in July, and employment increased substantially. The unemployment rate edged down to 6.9 percent, but remained near the level prevailing since April. The dollar value of total retail sales declined after having risen appreciably in July and August. The wholesale price index for all commodities, which had declined on balance since May, advanced in September; average prices of farm products and foods changed little following 3 months of sharp decreases, and average prices of industrial commodities rose more than in the immediately preceding months. So far this year the index of average hourly earnings has advanced at about the same pace as it had on the average during 1976.  Pressure on the dollar in foreign exchange markets emerged at the end of September, and the dollar has declined against most major foreign currencies and particularly against the Japanese yen. In August the U.S. foreign trade deficit widened; the July-August average was somewhat above the second-quarter rate.  M-1 and M-2 expanded somewhat more in September than in August, and increased substantially further in early October. Inflows to banks of time and savings deposits increased little in September from the reduced rate in August, while inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained strong. Short-term interest rates have risen further in recent weeks, and yields on longer-term market securities have increased.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  Growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 percent, 6-1/2 to 9 percent, and 8 to 10-1/2 percent, respectively, from the third quarter of 1977 to the third quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.",,
19771018,"10/17-18/77 -5 At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions during the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at about 6-1/2 percent, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the October-November period at annual rates within ranges of 3 to 8 percent and 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, respectively. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 percent.

The dollar value of total retail sales, which had been unchanged in September, rose substantially in October. Industrial production and employment increased somewhat. The unemployment rate, at 7.0 percent, remained in the narrow range prevailing since April. The wholesale price index for all commodities rose sharply in October, as average prices of farm products and foods increased after having declined appreciably over the preceding 4 months. Prices of industrial commodities rose at about the average rate of the preceding 12 months. The index of average hourly earnings increased sharply in September and has advanced at a somewhat faster pace so far this year than it had on the average during 1976.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined further since mid-October. In September the U. S. foreign trade deficit was reduced somewhat, in part as a result of temporary factors.  M-1 and M-2 increased substantially in October, but growth slowed sharply in early November. In October inflows to. banks of the total of savings deposits and small-—denomination time deposits fell off, but banks expanded the outstanding volume of large-denomination CD's substantially as credit demands strengthened.",,
19771115,"11/15/77  Inflows to nonbank thrift institutions slowed somewhat in October from the strong pace of  the preceding 2 months. Following a substantial rise in member bank borrowings,  Federal Reserve discount rates were increased from 5-3/4 to 6 percent in late October.  Market interest rates have fluctuated moderately since mid-October and most recently have tended to decline.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international trans actions.

However, the rise in average prices of industrial commodities was less rapid than in the preceding 2 months.  The index of average hourly earnings has advanced at a somewhat faster pace so far this year than it had on the average during 1976.  The dollar has been under considerable pressure in foreign exchange markets in recent weeks, and its trade-weighted value against major foreign currencies has declined more than 3 percent further since mid-November. In October the U. 8. foreign trade deficit widened sharply, primarily as a result of the dock strike at many U. S. ports.

The dollar value of total retail sales declined in December, but the gain from the third to the fourth quarter was substantial. Industrial production expanded somewhat further in December, although the rise was limited by a strike in coal mining. Employment increased appreciably, and the unemployment rate declined from 6.7 percent to 6.4 percent.

The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined about 2-1/2 percent further from mid-December to the early days of January but subsequently recovered about 1-3/4 percent.  M-1--which had declined slightly in November--rose in December. Growth in M-2 remained relatively slow, as inflows to banks of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's were sharply curtailed. Inflows to nonbank thrift institutions slowed somewhat further. Market interest rates edged up in late December, and rates-particularly for short-term securities--rose substantially further in the early weeks of January.",,

At its meeting on October 18, 1977, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 percent, 6-1/2 to 9 percent, and 8 to 10-1/2 percent, respectively, from the third quarter of 1977 to the third quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  At this time, the Committee seeks to maintain about the prevailing money market conditions during the period immediately ahead, provided that monetary aggregates appear to be growing at approximately the rates currently expected, which are believed to be on a path reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, the Committee seeks to maintain the weekly-average Federal funds rate at about the current level, so long as M-1 and M-2 appear to be growing over the January-February period at annual rates within ranges of 2-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent and 5 to 9 percent, respectively. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the weekly-average Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6-1/2 to 7 percent. In the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions, including the unsettled conditions in foreign exchange markets.

19780228,"2/28/78 -4 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that retail sales, industrial production, and housing starts were adversely affected in January by unusually severe weather. It appears, however, that there has been little change in the underlying economic situation. Employment increased further in January and the unemployment rate edged down from 6.4 to 6.3 percent. Both the consumer price index and the wholesale price index rose substantially. The index of average hourly earnings advanced sharply, as higher minimum wages became effective at the beginning of the year.  After a period of calm, the dollar came under renewed downward pressure around midFebruary, and its trade-weighted value against major foreign currencies has declined about 1-1/2 percent. The Swiss franc and the German mark have registered the most pronounced appreciations against the dollar.  M-1 expanded appreciably in January but declined somewhat in early February. Growth in M-2 picked up in January, reflecting some strengthening in inflows to banks of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's. Inflows to nonbank thrift institutions continued to slow. Market interest rates have changed little in recent weeks.

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real output of goods  and services has been adversely affected in the  current quarter by unusually severe weather and  the lengthy strike in coal mining but that there  has been little change in the underlying economic situation. In February industrial production",,
19780321,"3/21/78  recovered much of the decline of the preceding month, and nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably further. The unemployment rate declined from 6.3 to 6.1 percent. Retail  sales picked up somewhat from the sharply reduced level of January. The pace of the rise in prices stepped up in February, reflecting large increases in farm products and processed foods. The index of average hourly earnings was unchanged, after having advanced sharply in January when higher minimum wages became effective.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose sharply in anticipation of the U.S.- German announcements on March 13. Subsequently, the dollar declined to about the level at the end of February. The U. S. trade statistics reported for January showed a continuing large deficit.  M-1 declined and M-2 increased relatively little in February, apparently in part because of the economic effects of the coal strike and the severe weather. Inflows to banks of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 were about maintained, but the inflows were almost entirely into large-denomination time deposits exempt from ceilings on interest rates. Inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained slow. Market interest rates have changed little in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will encourage continued economic expansion and help resist inflationary pressures, while contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on February 28, 1978, the Committee agreed that growth of M-1, M-2, and",,
19780321,"3/21/78  -9 M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 percent,  6-1/2 to 9 percent, and 7-1/2 to 10 percent, respectively, from the fourth quarter of 1977 to the fourth quarter of 1978 appears to be consistent with these objectives. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the March-April period to be within ranges of 4 to 8 percent for M--l and 5-1/2 to 9 percent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate of about 6-3/4 percent. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6-1/2 to 7 percent. In the conduct of day-to-day operations, account shall be taken of emerging financial market conditions, including the conditions in foreign exchange markets.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

Prior to the following action Mr. Gardner entered the meeting.  By unanimous vote, the Committee adopted the following ranges for rates of growth in monetary aggregates for the period from the first quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979: M-1, 4 to 6-1/2 percent; M-2, 6-1/2 to 9 percent; and M-3, 7-1/2 to 10 percent. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period March 21 through April 17, 1978, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests  that growth in real output of goods and services was  small in the first quarter, owing in part to the unusually severe weather and the lengthy strike in coal mining, but that economic activity was rebounding in the latter part of the period. In March industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply further. The unemployment rate edged up from 6.1 to 6.2 percent, as the civilian labor force expanded substantially. Retail  sales recovered much more in February than had been reported earlier, and sales rose considerably further in March.",,
19780418,"4/18/78 -“4 The pace of the rise in wholesale prices remained rapid, reflecting further large increases in farm products and processed foods. The index of average hourly earnings accelerated in the first quarter, largely because of the increase in minimum wages at the beginning of the year.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined sharply after the March 31 announcement of a very large increase in the U. S. foreign trade deficit for February. But over the past week the dollar has recovered to about its level of 4 weeks ago.  M-L, which had declined in February, rose moderately in March. Inflows to banks of time and savings deposits other than negotiable CD's and inflows to nonbank thrift institutions remained slow. Most market interest rates, especially longer-term rates, have increased somewhat on balance in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  Growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 percent, 6-1/2 to 9 percent, and 7-1/2 to 10 percent, respectively, from the first quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979 appears to be consistent with these objectives. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  The Committee seeks to encourage near-term rates of growth in M-1 and M-2 on a path believed to be reasonably consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited in the preceding paragraph. Specifically, at present, it expects the annual growth rates over the April-May period to be within ranges of 4 to 8-1/2 percent for M-1 and 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M-2. In the judgment of the Committee such growth rates are likely to be associated with a weekly-average Federal funds rate slightly above the current level. If, giving approximately equal weight to M-1 and M-2, it appears that growth rates over",,
19780418,"4/18/78 -5 the 2-month period will deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the operational objective for the Federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion within a range of 6-3/4 to 7-1/2 percent.

If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the operating constraints specified above are proving to be significantly inconsistent, the Manager is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen over the past 4 weeks to the level prevailing at the beginning of the year. The trade deficit in the first quarter widened substantially from the already large deficit recorded in the final quarter of 1977.  M-1, which had grown moderately in the first quarter, rose sharply in April. Growth in M-2 and M-3 also stepped up but much less than growth in M-1, because inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in these aggregates remained slow. Market interest rates have increased in recent weeks. On May 11 an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 6-1/2 to 7 percent was announced.

By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period May 16 through June 19, 1978, were ratified.  With Messrs. Willes and Winn dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services has grown rapidly on the average in the current quarter as activity rebounded from the effects of the unusually severe winter weather and the lengthy coal strike, but the rate of advance most recently appears to be slowing. Following substantial gains in March and April, increases in industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment moderated in May and retail sales changed little. The unemployment rate edged up from 6.0 to 6.1 percent in association with a large increase in the civilian labor force. Average wholesale prices rose somewhat less rapidly in May than earlier in 1978, reflecting smaller reported increases in farm products and processed foods. So far this year prices have increased at a considerably faster rate than they had on average during 1977. The index of average hourly earnings also has increased at a somewhat faster pace so far in 1978 than during 1977.  Since the end of May the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined about 2 percent, but it remains above its early-April low. The trade deficit in April was down somewhat from its very high first-quarter rate.  Growth in M-1 moderated in May from the extraordinarily rapid pace in April, and as a result growth in M-2 and M-3 also slowed. Inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 picked up somewhat as commercial banks increased their reliance on large-denomination time deposits to finance an unusually sharp increase in business loans.  Market interest rates have risen somewhat further in recent weeks.",,
19780620,"6/20/78 -6 In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting on April 18, 1978, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the first quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979 at rates within ranges of  4 to 6-1/2 percent, 6-1/2 to 9 percent, and 7-1/2  to 10 percent, respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to developing conditions in financial markets more generally. During the period until the next regular meeting, System open market operations shall be directed initially at attaining a weekly-average Federal funds rate slightly above the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly Federal funds rate within the range of 7-1/2 to 8 percent.

Baughman, Willes, and Winn dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting  suggests that growth in economic activity has  slowed in recent months. Following substantial  gains in March and April, increases in  industrial production and nonfarm payroll  employment moderated in May and June and  retail sales changed little. In June, however,  the unemployment rate dropped 0.4 of a percentage point to 5.7 percent. Average  producer prices rose somewhat less rapidly in May and June than earlier in 1978, but",,
19780718,"7/18/78 -4 over the first half of this year prices increased at a considerably faster rate than they had on the average during 1977. The advance in the index of average hourly earnings also moderated in May and June but was at a somewhat faster pace over the first half of 1978 than during 1977.  Since mid-June the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined further to its lowest level of the year. The U. 8. trade deficit in May was lower than the very high rate of the first 4 months of the year.  Growth in M-1 moderated in May and June, but reflecting the extraordinarily rapid pace in April, growth from the first to the second quarter was relatively high. Growth in M-2 and M-3 has been moderate over recent months. In June inflows of small-denomination time deposits to commercial banks and other thrift institutions picked up, following introduction of the new 6-month certificate. Market interest rates have risen further in recent weeks. On June 30 an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 7 to 7-1/4 percent was announced.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the second quarter of 1978 to the second quarter of 1979 at rates within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 percent, 6-1/2 to 9 percent, and 7-1/2 to 10 percent, respectively.

During the period until the next regular meeting, System open market operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly-average Federal funds rate within the range of 7-3/4 to 8 percent. In deciding on the specific objective for the Federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the July-August period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 4 to 8 percent for M-1 and 6 to 10 percent for M-2.

19780815,"8/15/78 --4 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is growing moderately in the current quarter, although the pace is a little less than the average for the first two quarters of the year. In July retail sales remained at about the advanced level reached in April. Industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand at lower rates than in the early spring months. The unemployment rate, which had dropped 0.4 of a percentage point in June, jumped 0.5 of a percentage point in July to 6.2 percent, about the average rate in the first 5 months of the year. Average prices of goods and services have continued to rise rapidly, although producer prices of foods and foodstuffs declined in July. The advance in the index of average hourly earnings has been somewhat faster so far in 1978 than it had been on the average during 1977.  Since mid-July the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined sharply further. The U. S. trade deficit was lower in the second quarter than the very high rate of the first quarter.  Growth in M-1 remained moderate in July. Inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 and M-3 picked up, owing to substantial flows into large-denomination time deposits at banks and into the new money market certificates at nonbank thrift institutions. Nevertheless, expansion in the broader aggregates also remained moderate in July. Most market interest rates have declined appreciably on balance in recent weeks.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 18, 1978, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be",,
19780815,"8/15/78 --5 furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the second quarter of 1978 to the second quarter of  1979 at rates within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 percent, 6-1/2 to 9 percent, and 7-1/2 to 10 percent, respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.

In August the dollar value of total retail sales rose, after having declined in July, but remained close to the level reached in April. Industrial production continued to expand at about the moderate pace of the preceding 3 months, and nonfarm payroll employment rose somewhat further. The unemployment rate declined from 6.2 to 5.9 percent, slightly below the average rate in the first 7 months of the year. Since midyear average prices of goods and services have risen less rapidly than earlier, in large part because of declines in prices of foods. The advance in the index of average hourly earnings has been somewhat faster so far in 1978 than it had been on the average during 1977,  After a sharp decline in early August, the trade weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has recovered against a background of uncertain conditions in exchange markets. In late August it was announced that the U. S. trade deficit had increased sharply in July.  Growth in M-1 picked up in August to about the average rate in the first two quarters of the year. Inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 and M-3 also accelerated somewhat, and expansion in the broader aggregates was relatively rapid. Short-term market interest rates have risen appreciably since mid-August, but longer-term rates",,

In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 18, 1978, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the second quarter of 1978 to the second quarter of 1979 at rates within ranges of 4 to 6-1/2 percent, 6-1/2 to 9 percent, and 7-1/2 to 10 percent, respectively.

M-1 was expected to grow within a range of 2 to 6 percent over the period, depending  in part on the speed and extent of transfers from demand to",,

With Mrs. Teeters and Mr. Willes dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services grew moderately in the third quarter, although the pace was somewhat below the average for the first two quarters of the year. In September, as in August, the dollar value of total retail sales rose considerably. Industrial production continued to expand while nonfarm payroll employment changed little. The unemployment rate edged up from 5.9 to 6.0 percent. Average producer prices of finished goods rose substantially in September, as prices of foods increased sharply after having declined for 2 months. The advance in the index of average hourly earnings has been somewhat faster so far in 1978 than it had been on the average during 1977.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined further since mid-September in frequently volatile exchange markets. The U. S. trade deficit fell sharply in August, reversing the jump recorded in July; for the 2 months the deficit was close to the rate for the second quarter.",,
19781017,"10/17/78 -5 Growth in M-1, which had been rapid in August, accelerated in September. Inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 and M-3 remained strong, and expansion in the broader aggregates also accelerated somewhat. Short-term market interest rates have risen further in recent weeks; long-term rates also have increased, but they remain below their July peaks. An increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 7-3/4 to 8 percent was announced on September 22; another increase to 8-1/2 percent was announced on October 13.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. In setting ranges for the monetary aggregates, the Committee recognized the uncertainties concerning the effects that the November 1 introduction of the automatic transfer service (ATS) would have on measures of the money supply, especially M-1. Against that background, the Committee agreed that appropriate monetary and financial conditions would be furthered by growth of M-2 and M-3 from the third quarter of 1978 to the third quarter of 1979 within ranges of 6-1/2 to 9 percent and 7-1/2 to 10 percent, respectively. The narrowly defined money supply (M-1) was expected to grow within a range of 2 to 6 percent over the period, depending in part on the speed and extent of transfers from demand to savings deposits resulting from the introduction of ATS. The associated range for bank credit is 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent. Growth of M-1+ (M-1 plus savings deposits at commercial banks and NOW accounts) in a range of 5 to 7-1/2 percent was thought to be generally consistent with the ranges of growth for the foregoing aggregates. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are",,

19781121,"11/21/78 -5 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that in the current quarter real output of goods and services is continuing to grow moderately. In October industrial production expanded further, nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably, and the unemployment rate declined from 6.0 to 5.8 percent. Following 2 months of gains, the dollar value of total retail sales declined somewhat to a level slightly above the average in the third quarter. Average producer prices of finished goods rose substantially in October, as in September, in part because of further large increases in prices of foods. The advance in the index of average hourly earnings has been somewhat faster so far in 1978 than it was on the average during 1977. In late October the Government announced a new program aimed at moderating increases in prices and wages.  On November 1 a broad program to strengthen the dollar in foreign exchange markets and thereby to counter continuing domestic inflationary pressures was announced. The program included an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, establishment of a supplementary reserve requirement of 2 percent against member bank time deposits in denominations of $100,000 or more, increases in Federal Reserve reciprocal currency arrangements with certain central banks, and other measures to mobilize key foreign currencies.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined rapidly during the last week of October, but following the actions taken to strengthen the dollar, it rose sharply to a level somewhat above that in early October. The U. S. trade deficit was about the same in the third quarter as in the second quarter.  Growth in M-1, which had been rapid in August and September, slowed markedly in October, and growth in M-2 and M-3 also moderated. Inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in the broader aggregates slowed somewhat, although sales of 6-month money market",,
19781121,"11/21/78  certificates at both commercial banks and nonbank thrift institutions expanded to record levels. Short-term market interest rates have risen substantially further since mid-October. Bond rates also have increased on balance, although they have declined appreciably since November 1; mortgage interest rates have continued to rise.  In light of the foregoing developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging continued moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on October 17, 1978, in setting ranges for the monetary aggregates, the Committee recognized the uncertainties concerning the effects that the November 1 introduction of the automatic transfer service (ATS) would have on measures of the money supply, especially M-1. Against that background, the Committee agreed that appropriate monetary and financial conditions would be furthered by growth of M-2 and M-3 from the third quarter of 1978 to the third quarter of 1979 within ranges of 6-1/2 to 9 percent and 7-1/2 to 10 percent, respectively. The narrowly defined money supply (M-1) was expected to grow within a range of 2 to 6 percent over the period, depending in part on the speed and extent of transfers from demand to savings deposits resulting from the introduction of ATS. The associated range for bank credit is 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent. Growth of M-1+ (M-1 plus savings deposits at commercial banks and NOW accounts) in a range of 5 to 7-1/2 percent was thought to be generally consistent with the ranges of growth for the foregoing aggregates. These ranges are subject to reconsideration at any time as conditions warrant.",,
19781121,"11/2 /78 -7 In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar, to developing conditions in domestic financial markets, and to uncertainties associated with the introduction of ATS. Early in the period before the next regular meeting, System open market operations are to be directed at attaining a weekly average Federal funds rate slightly above the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average Federal funds rate within the range of 9-3/4 to 10 percent. In deciding on the specific objective for the Federal funds rate, the Manager is to be guided mainly by a range of tolerance for the annual rate of growth over the November-—December period of 6 to 9-1/2 percent in M-2, provided that the rate of growth in M-1 does not appear to exceed 5 percent.  The objective for the funds rate is to be raised or lowered within its range if the rate of growth of M-2 appears to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limit of its range. Weight is to be given to M-1 if it appears to be growing at a rate close to or above its limit.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be falling outside the limits of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",,

In November, as in October, the dollar value of total retail sales expanded substantially. Industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably further, and the unemployment rate remained at 5.8 percent. Over recent months, broad measures of prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen rapidly.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined sharply following OPEC's announcement on December 17 of increased oil prices for 1979, after having declined slightly over the previous few weeks, but it remains substantially above the low reached just prior to the actions taken on November 1 to strengthen the dollar. The U. 8S. trade deficit in October was at about the rate recorded in the second and third quarters.",,
19781219,"12/19/78 -4 M-1 declined in November, only in part because of shifts of funds from demand deposits to savings deposits after the introduction of the automatic transfer service (ATS) at the beginning of the month. Over the first 11 months of 1978, M-1 grew at an annual rate of about 7-1/4 percent. Growth of M-2 and M-3 slackened further in November; they grew at rates of about 8-1/4 and 9-1/4 percent, respectively, over the first 11 months of the year. Inflows of deposits to nonbank thrift institutions slowed in November, after having grown rapidly in the preceding 3 months. Market interest rates in general have risen further in recent weeks.

With Mr. Coldwell dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting  suggests that in the fourth quarter of 1978 growth in real output of goods and services picked up sharply from the reduced rate in the third quarter. In December, as in the preceding 2 months, the dollar value of total retail sales expanded substantially, and industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably further. Employment continued to grow in January, and the unemployment rate, at 5.8 percent, was virtually the same as in the final months of 1978. Over recent months, broad measures of prices and the  index of average hourly earnings have continued to rise rapidly.",,
19790206,"2/6/79 -4 The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has tended upward since the turn of the year, returning to about its level in mid-December prior to the OPEC announcement of increased oil prices. The U. 8S. trade deficit in the fourth quarter of 1978 was at about the same rate as in the second and third quarters.  M-1 increased little in December and appears to have declined in January, in part because of the continuing effects of the introduction of the automatic transfer service (ATS) on November 1, and M-2 and M-3 grew at relatively slow rates. With market interest rates relatively high, inflows to banks of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 slowed sharply, and inflows of deposits to nonbank thrift institutions slackened further. Over the year from the fourth quarter of 1977 to the fourth quarter of 1978 M-1, M-2, and M-3 grew about 7-1/4, 8-1/2, and 9-1/2 percent, respectively. Most market interest rates have declined on balance in recent weeks.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent,  5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent, respectively.

19790320,"3/20/79 -6 By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 6 and March 2, 1979, were approved.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 6 through March 19, 1979, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers' acceptances during the period February 6 through March 19, 1979, were ratified.  With Messrs. Coldwell, Kimbrel, Volcker, and Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting  suggests that in the current quarter growth in real output of goods and services has moderated from the rapid rate in the last quarter of 1978, while the rise in prices has accelerated. In January and February the dollar value of total retail sales rose slightly further. Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand over the two-month period, but in part because of severe weather, industrial production increased little. The unemployment rate in February, at 5.7 percent, was virtually unchanged from its level in January and in late 1978. Over recent months,  on balance, the index of average hourly earnings has continued to rise rapidly.",,
19790320,"3/20/79 -7T The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has shown no net change since early February. The U. S. trade deficit in January was larger than the monthly average in the fourth quarter of 1978, to some extent because of a bulge in imports of oil.  M-1 declined in both January and February, in part because of the continuing effects of the growth of the automatic transfer service. With market interest rates continuing high, inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 and M-3 remained at reduced levels, despite substantial flows into money market certificates at both commercial banks and nonbank thrift institutions. Over the two months, consequently, M-2 changed little and M-3 grew at a relatively slow rate.  The behavior of all three monetary aggregates was  affected by shifts of funds from deposits to money market mutual funds and other liquid assets. Most market interest rates have risen in recent weeks,  after having declined in January.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent, respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered in July or at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar and to developing conditions in domestic financial markets. Early in the period before the next regular meeting,",,
19790320,"3/20/79 -8 System open market operations are to be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate at about the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate within the range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent. In deciding on the specific objective for the federal funds rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the March-April period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 4 to 8 percent for M-1 and and 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent for M-2. If,.with approximately equal weight given to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be significantly above or below the midpoints of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is to be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  By unanimous vote, renewal for further periods of 3 months of System drawings on the German Federal Bank maturing March 31, 1979, through April 27, 1979, was authorized.  It was agreed that the authorization for the lending of Government securities from the System Open Market Account, contained in paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, should be retained at this time, subject to review in six months.

With Messrs. Coldwell, Volcker, and Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that in the first quarter of 1979 growth in real output of goods and services slowed substantially from the rapid rate in the last quarter of 1978, while the rise in prices accelerated. In March the dollar value of total retail sales, industrial production, and nonfarm payroll employment expanded considerably, but part of the strength was attributable to recovery from the effects of severe weather in the preceding two months. For the first quarter as a whole, retail sales in real terms declined somewhat, following a sharp increase in the fourth quarter of 1978, and the advance in industrial output slowed appreciably. Growth in employment remained strong in the quarter, however, and the unemployment rate in March, at 5.7 percent, was virtually",,
19790417,"4/17/79  unchanged from its level in late 1978 and the first two months of 1979. Over recent months, broad measures of prices have increased at a faster pace than during 1978, and the index of average hourly earnings has continued to rise rapidly.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen over the past four weeks, with the dollar showing particular strength against the yen, the Swiss franc, and the mark. The U. 8S. trade deficit in February was about half the. size of the large deficit in.January, but the average for the two months was above the monthly average in the fourth quarter of 1978.  M-1 increased slightly in March after having declined in both January and February. With market interest rates continuing high, inflows of the interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 and M-3 remained at reduced levels, despite substantial flows into money market certificates at both commercial banks and nonbank thrift institutions, and the broader monetary aggregates continued to grow at relatively slow rates. From the fourth quarter of 1978 to the first quarter of 1979, M-1 declined at an annual rate of about 2-1/2 percent, in part because of the effects of the growth of the automatic transfer service, and M-2 and M-3 grew at rates of about 1-1/2 percent and 4-1/2 percent, respectively. The behavior of all three monetary aggregates was affected by shifts of funds from deposits to money market mutual funds and other liquid assets. Since mid-March, market interest rates generally have risen somewhat, on balance.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade, and payments, and prices, it is the policy of the Federal",,
19790417,"4/17/79 -5 Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary. pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered  by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent, respectively. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered in July or at any time as conditions warrant.

19790522,"5/22/79 -3 With Messrs. Balles, Partee, and Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests a moderate pickup in growth of real output of goods and services in the current quarter from the sharply reduced pace in the first quarter, when public and private construction activity was adversely affected by unusually severe weather. In April, however, industrial production declined and growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed, in large part owing to effects of a work stoppage in the trucking industry early in the month. The unemployment rate, at 5.8 percent, remained at about the level prevailing earlier in the year. The dollar value of total retail sales rose somewhat in April, although apparently by less than the increase in average prices. Over recent months, broad measures of prices have increased at a faster pace than during 1978, and the index of average hourly earnings has continued to rise rapidly.  Demand for the dollar has continued strong in exchange markets over the past five weeks, and the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen further. The U. S. trade deficit declined further in March and was slightly lower in the first quarter as a whole than in the fourth quarter of 1978.  M-1 expanded sharply in April, after having declined in the first quarter, and M-2 and M-3 grew rapidly. The interest-bearing component of M-2 also grew rapidly, following several months of slow growth, as net flows into money market certificates at commercial banks increased while outflows of savings deposits slowed. At",,
19790522,"5/22/79 -4 nonbank thrift institutions, net flows into  money market certificates moderated, and overall inflows of funds receded from the already reduced pace of the first quarter. Since mid-April, short-term market interest rates have changed little, on balance; most longer-term rates have increased.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on February 6, 1979, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively.  The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered in July or at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short-run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to the program for supporting the foreign exchange value of the dollar and to developing conditions in domestic financial markets. Early in the period before the next regular meeting, System open market operations are to be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate at about the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate within the range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent. In deciding on the specific objective for the federal funds",,
19790522,"5/22/79 - 5  rate the Manager shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the May-June period of M-1 and M--2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 0 to 5 percent for M-1 and 4 to 8-1/2 percent for M-2. If, with approximately equal weight given to M-1 and M-2, their rates of growth appear to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is to be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates appear to be above the upper limit or below the lower limit of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the Situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

19790711,"7/11/79 -3 With Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Committee adopted the following ranges for rates of growth in monetary aggregates for the period from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979: M-1, 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent; M-2, 5 to 8 percent; and M-3, 6 to 9 percent. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent.  By unanimous vote, the Committee agreed that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980, growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3, and of commercial bank credit, might be within the ranges adopted for 1979, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicial developments affecting interest-bearing transactions accounts.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York _was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services declined somewhat in the second quarter, as slackening in demands was intensified by reduced supplies and sharply higher prices of motor fuels. During the quarter, the dollar value of retail sales declined, and in real terms, sales in June were substantially below last December. Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed during the quarter to a pace considerably below the preceding six months, but the unemployment rate in June, at 5.6 percent, was somewhat lower than earlier in the year. Industrial  production recovered in May, after having declined in April in large part because of a work stoppage.",,
19790711,"7/11/79 -4 Over the first half of this year, broad measures  of prices increased at a much faster pace than during 1978, although producer prices of foods declined in the second quarter. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings has slowed in recent months.  Downward pressure on the dollar in foreign exchange markets emerged in mid-June after several months of strength, and since then the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined about 3 percent. The U.S. trade deficit for April and May combined widened somewhat from the first-quarter rate.  M-1 expanded sharply in June, after having increased little in May, and M-2 and M-3 also grew rapidly. Inflows of interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 grew rapidly in June, as net flows into money market certificates at commercial banks expanded’ further and savings deposits increased for the first time since last September. At nonbank thrift institutions, inflows of deposits picked up from the sharply reduced pace in May. On a quarterly average basis, M-1 grew at an annual rate of about 7-1/2 percent in the second quarter, compared with a decline at a rate of about 2 percent in the first quarter; M-2 and M-3 grew at rates of about 8-1/2 percent and 7-3/4 percent respectively in the second quarter, compared with rates of about 1-3/4 percent and 4-3/4 percent in the first quarter. Market interest rates in general have declined substantially over the past several weeks, but mortgage interest rates have risen further.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.

Having established the range for M-1 in February on the assumption that expansion of ATS and NOW accounts would dampen growth by about 3 percentage points over the year, the",,
19790711,"7/11/79 -5 Committee also agreed that actual growth in M-1 might  vary in relation to its range to the extent of any deviation from that estimate. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. ‘The Committee anticipates that for the period from the fourth quarter  of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980, growth may be within the same ranges, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicial developments affecting interest-bearing transactions accounts.

In July the dollar value of retail sales’ edged up} in real terms, sales were still substantially below those of last December. Growth in nonfarm payroll employment slowed considerably further, but the unemployment rate, at 5.7 percent, remained within the narrow range prevailing since the beginning of the year. Industrial production declined in June, and it apparently slackened further in July to",,
19790814,"8/14/79 -8 about the. level of last December. So far this year, broad measures of prices have increased at  a much faster pace than during 1978, although producer prices of foods have declined since March. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings, which had slowed in May and June, picked up in July.  The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined somewhat further in the second half of July, and although it subsequently recovered, it remained below its level of early June. The U. S. trade deficit in the second quarter was larger than in the previous quarter, reflecting largely the Significant rise in the price and value of oil imports.  Growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 remained rapid in July. Inflows of interest-bearing deposits included in M-2 were slightly stronger than in June. ‘At nonbank thrift institutions, inflows of deposits declined somewhat. Short-term market interest rates have risen over recent weeks, while long-term rates have changed little on balance. An increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 9-1/2 to 10 percent was announced on July 20.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 11, 1979, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent, 5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively, the same ranges that had been established in February.

19790918,"9/18/79 -3 By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period August 14 through September 17, 1979, were ratified.  With Messrs. Balles, Black, Coldwell and Rice dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that in the third quarter real output of goods and services remained near the reduced level of the preceding quarter and that prices on the average continued to rise rapidly. In August, as in July, the dollar value of retail sales expanded moderately, but sales in real terms changed little and were ‘substantially below those of last December. Industrial production dropped from the May-July level, largely because of sharp curtailments in output of motor vehicles and parts. Nonfarm payroll employment was unchanged; the unemployment rate rose from 5.7 percent to 6.0 percent, thus moving above the narrow range in which it had fluctuated since the beginning of the year. Producer prices of finished goods continued to rise rapidly in August, led by further large increases in energy items and a substantial advance in consumer foods following a significant decline over the preceding four months. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings over the first eight months of this year was moderately below the pace during 1978, but the increase in total hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector has been about as rapid this year as last.  The dollar came under downward pressure in foreign exchange markets in the last days of August and the early days of September, but its trade weighted value against major foreign currencies",,
19790918,"9/18/79 -4 has changed little on balance since mid-August. The U. S. trade deficit in July was sharply reduced from the average in the first half of the year.  Growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 was relatively rapid in August and early September, although not so rapid as in June and July. Market interest rates have risen appreciably over recent weeks. An..increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 10 to 19-1/2 percent was announced on August 16.  Taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, unemployment, production, investment, real income, productivity, international trade and payments, and prices, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on July 11, 1979, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1978 to the fourth quarter of 1979 within ranges of 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent,  5 to 8 percent, and 6 to 9 percent respectively, the same ranges that had been established in February. Having established the range for M-1 in February on the assumption that expansion of ATS and NOW accounts would dampen growth by about 3 percentage points over the year, the Committee also agreed that actual growth in M-1 might vary in relation to its range to.the extent of any deviation from that estimate. The associated range for bank credit is 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. The Committee anticipates that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980, growth may be within the same ranges, depending upon emerging economic conditions and appropriate adjustments that may be required by legislation or judicial developments affecting interest-bearing transactions accounts. These ranges will be reconsidered at any time as conditions warrant.  In the short run, the Committee seeks to achieve bank reserve and money market conditions that are broadly consistent with the longer-run ranges for monetary aggregates cited above, while giving due regard to developing conditions in",,
19790918,"9/18/79 ---5 foreign exchange and domestic financial markets. Early in the period before the next regular meeting, System open market operations are to be directed  at attaining a weekly average federal funds rate slightly above the current level. Subsequently, operations shall be directed at maintaining the weekly average federal funds rate within the  range of 11-1/4 to 11-3/4 percent. In deciding  on the specific objective for the federal funds rate the Manager for Domestic Operations shall be guided mainly by the relationship between the latest estimates of annual rates of growth in the September-October period of M-1 and M-2 and the following ranges of tolerance: 3 to 8 percent  for M-1 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent for M-2. If rates of growth of M-1 and M-2, given approximately equal weight, appear to be close to or beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges, the objective for the funds rate is to be raised or lowered in an orderly fashion within its range.  If the rates of growth in the aggregates. appear to be beyond the upper or lower limits of the indicated ranges at a time when the objective for the funds rate has already been moved to the corresponding limit of its range, the Manager shall promptly notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from.the Committee.  It was agreed that the authorization for the lending of Government securities from the System Open Market Account, contained in paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, should be retained at this time, subject to review in six. months.

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and. directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services is declining in the current quarter, after the third quarter rebound, and that prices on the average are continuing to rise rapidly. Retail sales, which had expanded sharply during the third quarter in both constant and current dollars, dropped in October. Industrial production remained near its midyear level. Nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably, after three months of little growth, but the unemployment rate increased from 5.8 to 6.0 percent. Producer prices of finished goods continued to rise rapidly in October, in part because of further sharp increases in energy items and the spreading effects of earlier increases in energy costs. The rise in the index of average hourly earnings during the first 10 months of the year was close to the rapid pace during 1978.  On October 6 the Federal Reserve announced a series of complementary actions directed toward assuring control over the expansion.of money and bank credit and toward curbing speculative excesses in commodity and financial markets, including foreign exchange markets. The actions included an increase in Federal Reserve Bank discount rates from 11 percent to 12 percent; establishment of a marginal reserve requirement on increases in the total of managed liabilities of member banks, Edge corporations, and U. S. agencies and branches of foreign banks; and a shift in the conduct of open market operations to an approach placing greater emphasis in day-to-day operations on the supply of bank reserves and less emphasis on confining short-term fluctuations in the federal funds rate.",,
19791120,"11/20/79 -5 Following the announcement on October 6, the downward pressure on the dollar in the exchange markets that had developed in September was reversed, and by the end of October the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies had risen about 3-1/2 percent. In mid-November, however, the value of the dollar declined, reflecting in part developments concerning Iran. The U. 8S. foreign trade deficit increased in September as the cost of oil imports rose, but the deficit was somewhat lower for. the third quarter as a whole than for the second quarter.  Growth of M-1, which had accelerated in September and was exceptionally rapid in the third quarter as a whole, slowed sharply in October to an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent. Expansion of interest-bearing deposits included in M--2 remained strong, as a rise in net flows into time deposits at commercial banks in response to increased yields offset a contraction in savings deposits. Inflows of deposits at nonbank thrift institutions slowed somewhat. Flows into money market mutual funds accelerated. Growth of commercial bank credit moderated in October; nevertheless, banks increased their reliance on the negotiable, large-denomination CD's and other managed liabilities that became subject to the marginal reserve requirement in the statement week beginning October 11. Both short- and long-term market interest rates have risen. sharply on balance since. the early October announcement of the System's policy actions, although most recently rates have declined; mortgage interest rates have increased substantially further.

Over the past several months the rise in the  index of average hourly earnings has remained close to the rapid pace recorded earlier in 1979.",,
19800205,"2/4-5/80 -4 The trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies changed little in January, and exchange market pressures were relatively slight in spite of increased international political tensions. The U.S. foreign trade deficit rose in December, in large part because of an increase in imports of petroleum.  Growth of the major monetary aggregates, which had subsided in the final months of 1979, remained at reduced rates in January. Most market interest rates, especially long-term rates, have risen since the Committee's meeting in early January.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3% to 6, 4 to 6%, 6 to 9, and 6s to 945 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth over the first quarter of 1980 at an annual rate of about 4}, percent for M-1A and 5 percent for'M-1B, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 11 to 15% percent. The Committee believes that, consistent with this short-run policy, M-2 as newly defined should grow at an annual rate of about 645 percent over the first quarter.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 18, 1980, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.

By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on  February 4-5, 1980, were approved.",,
19800318,"3/18/80 -5 By unanimous. vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 4 through March 17, 1980, were ratified.  Pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Committee, by unanimous vote, expressly authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to enter into contracts to purchase foreign exchange at specified rates that reflected market rates of late February and early March and to transfer the foreign exchange so acquired directly to the Exchange Stabilization Fund at those same rates.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period February 4 through March 17, 1980, were ratified.  With Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real output of goods and services  continued to grow in the first quarter of 1980  and that the rise in prices accelerated. In  February retail sales declined moderately, but  the decrease followed an exceptionally large  increase in January. Industrial production  expanded somewhat in both months, after a  period of little change, and nonfarm payroll employment continued to rise. The unemployment",,
19800318,"3/18/80 -6 rate edged down in February to 6.0 percent. Private housing starts declined further in January and were more than one-fifth below the rate in the third quarter of last year. The rise in producer prices of finished goods and in consumer prices was more  rapid in the first month or two of 1980 than in 1979, despite some easing in prices of foods. Over the first two months of 1980 the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat below the rapid pace recorded in 1979.  The dollar has been in strong demand in exchange markets since mid-February, largely in response to rising U. S. interest rates; by early March the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies had returned to about the level reached at the end of last October, and since then, it has risen further. Intervention by foreign monetary authorities to support their currencies was very heavy in February and the first half of March. The U. S. foreign trade deficit rose sharply in January, although the volume and value of imports of petroleum were somewhat reduced.  Growth of M-1A and M-1B, which had remained moderate in January, accelerated sharply in February, and growth of M-2 also quickened. In recent weeks, however, monetary growth has subsided. Expansion of commercial bank credit picked up in the first two months of this year from the reduced pace in the fourth quarter of 1979. Market interest rates have risen substantially in recent weeks. An increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 12 to 13 percent was announced early on February 15, effectively immediately.  On March 14 the President announced a broad program of fiscal, energy, credit, and other measures designed to moderate and reduce inflationary forces in a manner that can also lay the groundwork for a return to stable economic growth. Consistent with that objective and with the continuing intent of the Federal Reserve System to restrain growth in money and credit during 1980, the Board",,
19800318,"3/18/80 -7 of Governors took the following actions to reinforce the effectiveness of the measures announced in October 1979: 1. A special credit restraint program; 2. A special deposit requirement for all lenders on increases in certain types ‘of consumer credit; 3. An increase in the marginal reserve requirement on managed liabilities of large member banks; 4. A special deposit requirement on increases in managed liabilities of large nonmember banks; 5. A special deposit requirement on increases in total assets of money market mutual funds; 6. A surcharge of  3 percentage points on frequent borrowings of large member banks from Federal Reserve Banks.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on February 4-5, 1980, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3-1/2 to 6, 4 to 6-1/2, 6 to 9, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth over the first half of 1980 at an annual rate of 4-1/2 percent for M-1A and 5 percent for M-1B, or somewhat less, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 13 to 20 percent. The Committee believes that, consistent with this short-run policy, M-2 should grow at an annual rate of about 7-3/4 percent over the first half and expansion of bank credit should slow in the months ahead to a pace compatible with growth over the year as a whole within the range agreed upon.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",,
19800318,"3/18/80 -8 Consideration was then given to the continuing authorizations of the Committee, in accordance with the customary practice of reviewing such matters at the first regular meeting in March of every year.  Secretary's note: On March 5, 1980, certain continuing authorizations of the Committee listed below, had been distributed by the Secretary with the advice that, in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee, they were being called to the Committee's attention before the March organization meeting to give members an opportunity to raise any questions they had concerning them. Members were asked to so indicate if they wished to have any of the authorizations in question placed on the agenda for consideration at this meeting, and no such requests were.received.

19800422,"4/22/80  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that economic activity turned down in the latter part of the first quarter of 1980, although for the quarter as a whole real GNP expanded somewhat further and the rise in prices accelerated. Retail sales in real terms declined sharply in February and March, after having increased in January. In March industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment declined, and the unemployment rate edged up to 6.2 percent. Private housing starts declined throughout the first quarter, to a rate in March about two-fifths below that in the third quarter of last year. The rise in producer prices of finished goods and in consumer prices was considerably more rapid during the first three months of 1980 than in 1979. Over the first quarter, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat above the rapid pace recorded in 1979.  The strong demand for the dollar in exchange markets that began in mid-February persisted through early April. Some selling pressure developed in the second week of April as market participants reacted to indications that U.S. interest rates might have peaked, but the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies remained well above its level of early February. The U.S. foreign trade deficit rose further in February.  M-1A and M-1B, which had expanded sharply in February, contracted in March and early April; M-2 increased relatively little in March. From December to March, M-1A and M-1B grew at annual rates of about 4 percent and 4-1/2 percent respectively, and M-2 grew at a rate of 7 percent. Expansion of commercial bank credit slowed substantially in March from the accelerated pace earlier in the year. Since midMarch, most market interest rates on balance have declined considerably. :  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its",,
19800422,"4/22/80 -4  meeting on February 4-5, 1980, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3-1/2 to 6, 4 to 6-1/2, 6 to 9, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks expansion of reserve aggregates consistent with growth over ‘the first half of 1980 at an annual rate of 4-1/2 percent for M-1A and 5 percent for M-1B, or somewhat less, provided that in the period before the next regular meeting the weekly average federal funds rate remains within a range of 13 to 19 percent.  The Committee believes that, to be consistent with this short-run policy, M-2 should grow at an annual rate of about 6-3/4 percent over the first half and that bank credit should grow in the months ahead at a pace compatible with growth over the year as a whole within the range agreed upon.  If it appears during the period before the next meeting that the constraint on the federal funds rate is inconsistent with the objective for the expansion of reserves, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 20, 1986, beginning at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary",,

Partee and Roos dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance. with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting  suggests a marked contraction in real GNP in the current quarter. In April the dollar value of total retail sales declined substantially for the third consecutive month. Industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment were curtailed sharply, and the.unemployment rate rose from 6.2 to 7.0 percent. Private housing starts, which. had declined throughout the first quarter to a relatively low rate, edged down further in April.  The overall rise in prices of goods and services has remained rapid in recent months, although in",,
19800520,"5/20/80 -4 April the rise in producer prices of finished goods was slowed by a large decrease in foods and by a lessening of the rapid rise in energy items. Over the first four months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat less than the rapid pace recorded in 1979.  The downward pressure on the dollar in exchange markets that emerged in early April has continued over most of the past four weeks, in response primarily to the sharp decline in U. S. interest rates relative to foreign interest rates; the trade weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined about 3-1/2 percent. The U. S. foreign trade deficit was substantially larger in the first quarter of 1980 than in the preceding quarter, despite a considerable decline in March from the average in the preceding two months.  M-1A and M-1B contracted sharply further in April, and M-2 also declined. Commercial bank credit, both loans and investments, contracted in April after having slowed substantially in March. Over recent weeks,: market interest rates have : declined sharply further.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting on February 4-5, 1980, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 3-1/2 to 6, 4 to 6-1/2, 6 to 9, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.

In May total retail sales declined substantially for the fourth consecutive month, and housing starts, industrial production, and nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline. Employment fell sharply further in June; however, the unemployment rate edged down from 7.8 to 7.7 percent, following large increases in April and May. The overall rise in prices of goods and services has moderated in recent months, in large part owing to a lessening of the rapid rise in energy items. Over the first six months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was moderately faster than the pace recorded in 1979.  The downward pressure on the dollar in exchange markets that emerged in early April abated in mid-June, and then was resumed in early July. The average U.S. foreign trade deficit for April and May was well below the average for the first quarter, reflecting reduced oil and non-oil imports.  Monetary expansion was rapid in June, following weakness earlier in the spring. Over the first half of the year growth of M-1A and M-1B fell short of the rates consistent with the Committee's ranges for the year from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980; the rate of growth for M-2 was just above the lower bound of its range. Outstanding bank loans to business declined substantially during the second quarter following a large increase in the first quarter. Market interest rates declined considerably further in late May and the first half of June, but",,
19800709,"7/9/80 -5 since then most rates have retraced part of the decline. Reductions in Federal Reserve discount rates from 13 to 11 percent in equal steps were announced on May 28 and June 12.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while encouraging moderate economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.

While industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline sharply in June, total retail sales advanced after four months of substantial decreases, and housing starts rose from a depressed level. In July retail sales advanced further; nonfarm payroll employment declined, but not so sharply as during the second quarter, and the unemployment rate edged up from 7.7 to 7.8 percent. The overall rise in prices of goods and services moderated in the second quarter, in large part owing to a lessening of the rapid rise in energy items. Over the first seven months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat faster than the pace recorded in 1979.",,
19800812,"8/12/80  The weighted average value of the dollar in exchange markets has risen somewhat since late July, after having fluctuated in a narrow range earlier in the month. A reduced U.S. foreign trade deficit in June brought the average for the second quarter well below the average for the first quarter.  Monetary expansion remained rapid in July, although not so rapid as in June. The recent resurgence brought growth of M-1A closer to and that of M-1B about to the lower bounds of the Committee's ranges for the year from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980. However, the rate of growth for M-2 was near the upper bound of its range. Market interest rates have risen considerably further in recent weeks.  Taking account of past and prospective economic developments, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 34 to 6 percent, 4 to 64 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 64 to 9% percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. For the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981, the Committee looked toward a reduction in the ranges for growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 on the order of 4 percentage point from the ranges adopted for 1980, abstracting from institutional influences affecting the behavior of the aggregates. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.

With Messrs. Guffey, Roos, Wallich, and Winn dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the decline in economic activity has moderated in the third quarter following a sharp contraction in the second quarter. Industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment expanded in August after several months of decline; the unemployment rate edged down from 7.8 to 7.6 percent; and total retail sales advanced considerably further. In July housing starts rose slightly, following a substantial rebound in June, and were well above the depressed levels of the preceding three months. Producer prices of finished goods rose rapidly in July and August, after increasing at a sharply reduced pace in the second quarter; the recent advance reflected mainly a surge in food prices. Over the first eight months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat faster than the pace recorded in 1979.  The weighted average value of the dollar in exchange markets has declined somewhat over the past five weeks. The U.S. trade deficit in July was significantly lower than the monthly average in the second quarter, reflecting a sharp decline in petroleum imports.  M-1A and M-1B grew at record rates in August, while growth in M-2 moderated from an exceptionally rapid pace in June and July. For the year through August growth of M-1A was in the lower half and growth of M-1B in the upper half of their respective ranges set by the Committee for the year from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth",,

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1980 within ranges of 34 to 6 percent, 4 to 6% percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 64 to 9% percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.

In the short-run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates associated with growth of M-lA, M-1B, and M-2 over the first quarter along a path consistent with the ranges fox growth in 1981 contemplated earlier, which will be reviewed in February 1981. Those ranges, abstracting from the effects of deposit shifts connected with the introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis, imply growth in these aggregates centered on 4-1/4 percent, 4-3/4 percent, and 7 percent respectively. It is recognized that the introduction of NOW and ATS accounts nationwide at the beginning of 1981 is likely to widen the discrepancy between growth in M-1A and M-1B to an extent that cannot now be accurately estimated, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those differences as they emerge. In the light of the rapid growth of monetary and credit aggregates in recent months, some shortfall in growth would be acceptable in the near term if that developed in the context of reduced pressures in the money market. If it appears during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of 15 to 20 percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",,

With Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Committee adopted the following ranges for rates of growth in the monetary aggregates for the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis: M-1A, 3 to 5-1/2 percent; M-1B, 3-1/2 to 6 percent; M-2, 6 to 9 percent; and M-3, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  With Mrs. Teeters and Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance  with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP expanded substantially in the fourth quarter of 1980 and that prices on the average continued to rise rapidly. In December industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment expanded further, and the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at about 7-1/2 percent. Retail sales declined, however, following a sizable gain over the preceding six months. Housing starts were about unchanged for the third month. Over the last few months of 1980, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was at about the rapid pace recorded earlier in the year.  The weighted average value of the dollar in exchange markets has risen further over the past six weeks. The U.S. trade deficit in the final quarter of 1980 widened from the exceptionally low rate in the third quarter but remained substantially less than the rate in the first half.  M-1A and M-1B declined sharply in December; in January, after adjustment of the actual figures for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, these aggregates recovered in part. Growth in M-2 slowed markedly in December but accelerated in January. Some",,
19810203,"2/2-3/81 -4 moderation of the expansion in commercial bank credit  in December and early January was accompanied by stepped up financing of nonfinancial businesses through issuance of commercial paper and longer-term debt instruments. Market interest rates have declined on balance from  their highs of mid-December.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. The Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 within ranges of 3 to 5-1/2 percent, 3-1/2 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.  In the short-run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth in M-1A and M-1B from December to March at annual rates of 5 to 6 percent and in M-2 at a rate of about 8 percent, abstracting from the impact of flows into NOW accounts. These rates are associated with growth of M-1A, M-1B, and M-2 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the first quarter of 1981 at annual rates of about 2 percent, 2-3/4 percent, and 7 percent. respectively. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M-1A and M-1B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. If it appears during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of 15 to 20 percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.

The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or, under special circumstances, such as when the New York Reserve Bank is closed, any other Federal Reserve Bank) (a) to lend to the Treasury such amounts of securities held in the System Open Market Account as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, under such conditions as the Committee may specify; and (b) to purchase directly from the Treasury for renewable periods not to exceed thirty days, when authorized by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuant to an affirmative vote of not less than five members, for its own account (with discretion, in cases where it seems desirable, to issue participations to one or more Federal Reserve Banks) such amounts of special short-term certificates of indebtedness as may be necessary from time to time for the temporary accommodation of the Treasury, provided that the rate charged on such certificates shall be a rate 1/4 of 1 percent below the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time of such purchases and provided that the total amount of such certificates held at any one time by the Federal Reserve Banks shall not exceed $2 billion.",,

Government securities held in the System Open Market Account: to Government securities dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.  4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U. $. Government securities to such foreign and international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(c), repurchase agreements in I. S$. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its -own account and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.  It was agreed that the authorization for the lending of Government securities from the System Open Market Account, contained in paragraph 3 of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, should be retained at t is time, subject to annual review.  With Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was. authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following  domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP expanded substantially in the first quarter of 1981, but there were signs of a slowing of the expansion in economic activity during the quarter; prices on the average continued to rise rapidly. While retail sales advanced appreciably over the first two months of the year, industrial production declined in February after three months of diminishing gains and housing starts dropped from the moderate pace that had prevailed during the preceding six months. Nonfarm payroll employment changed little in February following a large increase in January; the unemployment rate, at 7.3 percent, was essentially unchanged. Over the first two months of 1981, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was little changed from the rapid pace recorded during 1980.",,
19810331,"3/31/81 - 13  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose further following the Committee's meeting in early February to a peak at midmonth but subsequently declined somewhat on balance. Short-term interest rates in continental European countries have risen appreciably since mid-February, absolutely and in relation to interest rates on dollar-denominated assets. The U.S. trade deficit in  January and February was at about the average monthly rate of the final quarter of 1980.  M-1A and M-1B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, changed little over the first two months of the year but expanded substantially in the first half of March. Growth in M-2 accelerated in the course of the quarter and partial data suggest considerable strength in March, in part because of large flows into money market mutual funds. On balance since early February, short-term market interest rates have fallen substantially while longer term market rates have risen somewhat.  _The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, encourage economic recovery, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 within ranges of 3 to 5-1/2 percent, 3-1/2 to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis.  The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.  In the short-run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth in M-1B from March to June at an annual rate of 5-1/2 percent or somewhat less, after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts, and growth in M-2 at an annual rate of about 10-1/2 percent. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M-1B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. If it appears during the period before the next meeting that fluctuations in the federal funds rate, taken over a period of time, within a range of 13 to 18 percent are likely to be inconsistent with the monetary and related reserve paths, the Manager for Domestic Operations is promptly to notify the Chairman, who will then decide whether the situation calls for supplementary instructions from the Committee.",,

19810518,"5/18/81 -3 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP will grow much less rapidly in the current quarter, following the substantial expansion in the first quarter; prices on the average have continued to rise rapidly, although somewhat less so most recently than earlier in the year. The dollar value of total retail sales increased slightly further in March, but it declined appreciably in April when sales of new cars fell in response to the ending of price concessions. Industrial production rose moderately in both months, while nonfarm payroll employment changed little, after adjustment for strikes, and the unemployment rate was stable at 7.3 percent. In March housing starts remained at a reduced pace. Over the first four months of 1981, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was slightly less rapid than during 1980,  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen steadily since the end of March to its highest level in three and a half years. The U.S. trade deficit declined sharply in March, bringing the first quarter deficit to a level well below the 1980 average.  Growth in M-1B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, accelerated sharply in April and growth in M-2 remained rapid. Since March, both short-term and long-term market interest rates have risen substantially. On May 4 the Board of Governors announced an increase in Federal Reserve discount rates from 13 to 14 percent and an increase in the surcharge from 3 to 4 percentage points on frequent borrowings of large institutions.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote economic growth, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M-1A, M-1B, M-2, and M-3 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 within ranges of 3 to 54 percent, 34s to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6 to 94 percent respectively, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. These ranges will be reconsidered as conditions warrant.  In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with a substantial deceleration of growth in M-1B from April to June to an annual rate of 3 percent or lower, after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts, and with growth in M-2 at an annual rate of about 6 percent.",,
19810518,"5/18/81 --4 The shortfall in growth of M-1B from the two-month rate specified above would be acceptable, in light of the rapid growth  in April and the objective adopted by the Committee on March 31 for growth from March to June at an annual rate of 5% percent  or somewhat less. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M-1B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 16 to 22 percent.

19810707,"7/6-7/81 -3 By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed the ranges for growth in the monetary aggregates for the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 that it had adopted at its meeting in early February 1981. These ranges, abstracting from the impact of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis, were 3 to 5-1/2 percent for M1-A, 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M1-B, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee recognized that a shortfall in M1-B growth in the first half of the year partly reflected a shift in public preferences toward other highly liquid assets and that growth in the broader aggregates had been running somewhat above the upper ends of the ranges. In light of its desire to maintain moderate growth in money over the balance of the year, the Committee expected that growth in M1-B for the year would be near the lower end of its range. At the same time, growth in the broader monetary aggregates might be high in their ranges.  With Mrs. Teeters dissenting, the Committee tentatively agreed that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 growth of M1, M2, and M3 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent,  6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, respectively would be appropriate.

19810707,"7/6-7/81 -4 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP changed little in the second quarter, following the substantial expansion in the first quarter; prices on the average rose less rapidly than in the first quarter. The dollar value of total retail sales was virtually unchanged in May after having declined appreciably in April, and sales of new cars remained weak in June. Industrial production rose slightly on the average in April and May, while nonfarm payroll employment continued to advance, after adjustment. for strikes. In June strike-adjusted nonfarm employment declined appreciably; the unemployment rate was 7.3 percent, somewhat lower than in May but unchanged from earlier months of 1981. In May housing starts declined sharply. Over the first six months of 1981, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was slightly less rapid than during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued to rise through May and early June and then leveled off. In April-May the U.S. foreign trade deficit was somewhat above the first-quarter rate.  M1-B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, declined substantially in May and June following the sharp expansion in April, and growth in M2 slowed. The level of adjusted M1-B in the second quarter on the average was below the lower end of the Committee's range for growth over the year from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981; the level of M2 in the second quarter was. slightly above the upper end of its range for the year. Since mid-May, on balance, short-term market interest rates have declined somewhat while long-term yields generally have changed little.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote sustained economic growth, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by growth of M1-A, MI1-B, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 within ranges of 3 to 54 percent, 3% to 6 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6% to 94 percent respectively, abstracting from the impact of introduction of NOW accounts on a nationwide basis. The Committee recognized that the shortfall in M1-B growth in the first half of the year partly reflected a shift in public preferences toward other highly liquid assets and that growth in the broader aggregates has been running somewhat above the upper ends of the ranges.

At the same time, growth in the broader aggregates may be high in their ranges. .The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee also tentatively agreed that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 growth of M1, M2, and M3 within ranges of 24; to 5 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 645 to 94 percent would be appropriate. These ranges will be reconsidered as warranted to take account of developing experience with public preferences for NOW and similar accounts as well as changing economic and financial conditions.  In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1-B from June to September at an annual rate of 7 percent after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts (resulting in growth at an annual rate of about 2 percent from the average in the second quarter to the average in the third quarter), provided that growth of M2 remains around the upper limit of, or moves within, its range for the year. It is recognized that shifts into NOW accounts will continue to distort measured growth in M1-B to an unpredictable extent, and operational reserve paths will be developed in the light of evaluation of those distortions.

The dollar value of total retail sales increased appreciably further in July, reflecting some recovery in sales at automotive dealers. Industrial production rose slightly in July, while nonfarm payroll employment advanced substantially; the unemployment rate declined to 7.0 percent, somewhat below its average level in earlier months of 1981. In June housing starts declined sharply further. Over the first seven months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat less rapid than during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar rose further against major foreign currencies in July and early August, registering gains against all major currencies. In June the U.S. foreign trade deficit declined slightly from the May level, but for the second quarter the deficit was up substantially over the first-quarter rate.  In July M1-B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, expanded somewhat following a substantial decline in May and June, and growth in M2 accelerated from a relatively sluggish pace in the previous two months. The level of adjusted M1-B in July was well below the lower end of the Committee's range for growth over. the year from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 while the level of M2 was slightly below the upper end of its range for the year. Available data -for early August suggested further acceleration in growth of M1-B and M2, with acceleration in M2 apparently influenced in part by initial responses of the public to the availability of more attractive deposit instruments,- pointing up the necessity of evaluating the behavior of M2 in the light of the impact of regulatory and legislative changes. Since early July most market interest rates have risen considerably on balance.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote sustained economic growth, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its neat ing in early July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 that it had set at the February meeting.

In light of its desire to maintain moderate growth in money over the balance of the year, the Committee expected that growth in M1-B for the year would be near the lower end of its range.

The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 15 to 21 percent.",,

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP declined slightly further in the third quarter and that prices on the average continued to rise at the somewhat lower rate that emerged in the second quarter. In July and August the nominal value of total retail sales was essentially unchanged from the June level, and unit sales of domestic automobiles weakened in September. Industrial production declined slightly in August and apparently slackened further in September, while nonfarm payroll employment changed little in both months. The unemployment rate rose to 7.5 percent in September, about equal to its average in the first half of 1981. Housing starts fell in August to the lowest rate in several years. Over the first nine months of the year, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was somewhat less rapid than during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies declined sharply through mid-September from its peak in early August and on balance has changed little since then. In August the U.S. foreign trade deficit widened substantially from the low rate in July; for July and August combined, the deficit was considerably larger than the second quarter rate.  M1-B, adjusted for the estimated effects of shifts into NOW accounts, increased little over the period from June to September, while M2 grew at a relatively strong pace. The level of adjusted M1-B in September was well below the lower end of the Committee's range for growth over the year from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981; the level of M2 was at the upper end of its range for the year. In frequently volatile markets, short term interest rates have declined on balance since mid-August while long-term rates have risen considerably further. On September 21 the Board of Governors announced a reduction in the surcharge from 4 to 3 percentage points on frequent borrowings of large depository institutions.",,
19811006,"10/5-6/81 -b The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote sustained economic growth, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981 that it had set at the February meeting. These ranges included growth of 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M1-B, abstracting from the impact of flows into NOW accounts on a nationwide basis, and growth of 6 to 9 percent and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and M3, respectively. The Committee recognized that the shortfall in M1-B growth in the first half of the year partly reflected a shift in public preferences toward other highly liquid assets and that growth in the broader aggregates had been running at about or somewhat above the upper ends of their ranges. In light of its desire to maintain moderate growth in money over the balance of the year, the Committee expected that growth in M1-B for the year would be near the lower end of its range. At the same time, growth in the broader aggregates might be high in their ranges. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee also tentatively agreed that for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 growth of M1, M2, and M3 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent would be appropriate. These ranges will be reconsidered as warranted to take account of developing experience with public preferences for NOW and similar accounts as well as changing economic and financial conditions.  In the short run the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1-B from September to December at an annual rate of 7 percent after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts and with growth in M2 at an annual rate around 10 percent or slightly higher, recognizing that the behavior of M2 will be affected by recent regulatory and legislative changes, particularly the public's response to the availability of the all savers certificate.

19811117,"11/17/81 -4   The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP is declining appreciably in the current quarter and that prices on the average are rising somewhat less rapidly than over the first three quarters of the year. In October the nominal value of total retail sales dropped; industrial production fell more than in September; and nonfarm payroll employment, especially in-manufacturing, declined sharply. The unemployment rate rose from 7.5 percent to 8.0 percent. Housing starts edged down in September from an already depressed level. Over the first 10 months of 1981, the rise in the index of average hourly earnings was less rapid than during 1980.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has declined only a little since early October, although U.S. short-term interest rates have declined more than foreign rates. A reduced U.S. foreign trade deficit in September brought the deficit for the third quarter close to the second-quarter rate.  M1-B (adjusted for estimated shifts into NOW accounts) expanded in October almost as much as it had declined in September, and growth of M2 picked up. The level of adjusted M1-B remained well below the lower end of the Committee's range for growth over the year from the fourth quarter of 1980 to the fourth quarter of 1981; the level of M2 was at the upper end of its range for the year. Short-term market interest rates have declined substantially since the end of September, and bond yields have also dropped from the peaks generally reached about then. On October 30 the Board of Governors announced a reduction in Federal Reserve basic discount rates from 14 to 13 percent. The surcharge on frequent borrowings of large depository institutions had been reduced from 3 to 2 percentage points on October 9, and on November 16 the Board removed the remaining 2 percentage points.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.

These ranges will be reconsidered as warranted to take account of developing experience with public preferences for NOW and similar accounts as well as changing economic and financial conditions.  The Committee, after noting a moderate shortfall in growth of M1-B in October from the target path set at the last meeting, seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1-B from October to December at an annual rate of about 7 percent (after allowance for the impact of flows into NOW accounts) and with growth of M2 at an annual rate around 11 percent.

Growth of M2 accelerated sharply in November, raising its level above the upper end of its range for the year. Short-term market interest rates and bond yields continued to decline in the latter part of November, but since then they have risen to levels generally higher than those of mid-November; over the period since mid-November, mortgage interest rates have declined further.

The target for M1 no longer reflects the “shift-adjustment"" for conversion of outstanding interest-bearing assets into new NOW accounts, formerly estimated in the ""“shift-adjusted"" M1-B series. In setting the M1 target the Committee took account of the relatively rapid growth that had already taken place through the first part of December; it also recognized that interpretation of actual money growth may need to take account of the significance of fluctuations in NOW accounts, which have recently been growing relatively rapidly.

In the fourth quarter the U.S. foreign trade deficit increased from the rate in the previous two quarters.  M1 grew rapidly in December and January, reflecting in part rapid expansion in checkable deposits other than demand accounts.

By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed the agreement of January 17, 1977, to “warehouse” foreign currencies for the Exchange Stabilization Fund and for the Treasury on the terms agreed upon by the Committee at its meeting on March 18, 1980, with the understanding that the agreement would be subject to annual review.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 1-2, 1982, were approved.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period February ? through March 29, 1982, were ratified.  Secretary's note: All of the preceding actions were taken on Monday, March 29, 1982.  With Messrs. Black and Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that  real GNP declined appreciably further in the first quarter of 1982 but that final purchases were sustained and the contraction in activity moderated during the quarter; prices  on the average rose much less rapidly than in the preceding quarter. In January weakness in activity was accentuated by",,
19820330,"3/29-30/82 -14 unusually severe weather, and in February the nominal value  of retail sales rebounded while industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment recovered part of their January declines. The unemployment rate in February, at 8.8 percent, was unchanged from December. Although housing starts rose further in the first two months of the year, they remained  at a depressed level. The rise in both the consumer price index and the producer price index for finished goods moderated substantially, and the advance in the index of average hourly earnings on the average remained at a reduced pace.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued to rise strongly in February and March; foreign monetary authorities intervened on a substantial scale to resist the depreciation of their currencies. The U.S. foreign trade deficit in January and February on the average was somewhat less than the fourth-quarter rate.  M1 declined in February, after three months of rapid growth, and then increased moderately in early March. Growth of M2 slowed appreciably in February, owing to a slackening of the expansion in the nontransaction component as well as to the decline in Ml. Short-term market interest rates and bond yields on balance have declined since early February, and mortgage interest rates have edged down.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that its objectives would be furthered by growth of M1, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent.  In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from March to June at annual rates of about 3 percent and 8 percent respectively. The Committee also noted that deviations from these targets should be evaluated in light of the probability that M2 would be less affected over the period than M1 by deposit shifts related to the tax date and by changes in the relative importance of NOW accounts as a savings vehicle. Some shortfall in growth of M1, consistent",,
19820330,"3/29-30/82  with  - 15  progress toward the upper part of the range for the year as  a whole, would be acceptable in the context of appreciably reduced  pressures in the money market and relative strength of other  aggregates. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation  if it  appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit  of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the  period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 12 to 16 percent.  Committee  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market would be held on Tuesday, May 18, 1982, at 9:30 a.m. The meeting adjourned.  Secretary's Note: On April 13-14, 1982, by unanimous vote, (with Mr. Roos voting as alternate for Mr. Ford), Committee members voted to increase from $3 billion to $5 billion the limit on changes between Committee meetings in System Account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities specified in paragraph 1(a) of the authorization for domestic open market operations, effective immediately, for the period ending with the close of business on May 18, 1982.  Secretary's Note: On April 26-27, 1982, by unanimous vote, (with Messrs. Roos and Guffey voting as alternates for Messrs. Ford and Balles, respectively, and Mr. Gramley absent), Committee members voted to approve an additional increase of $1 billion, to $6 billion, in the intermeeting limit on changes in holding of U.S. government and federal agency securities.

With Mrs. Teeters dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following  domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP will change little in the current quarter after the appreciable further decline in the first quarter, as business inventory liquidation moderates from last quarter's extraordinary rate. In April the nominal value of retail sales expanded, while industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline. The unemployment rate rose 0.4 percentage point to 9.4 percent. Although housing starts edged up in March for the fifth consecutive month, they remained at a depressed level, The rate of increase in prices on the average appears to be slowing somewhat further in the current quarter; so far this year both the consumer price index and the producer price index for finished goods have risen little on balance, and the advance in the index of average hourly earnings has remained at a reduced pace.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies, after rising somewhat further in early April, has fallen sharply over the past month, reflecting in part a decline in U.S. interest rates relative to foreign rates and market expectations of further declines. The U.S. foreign trade deficit in the first quarter was one-third less than in the preceding quarter.",,
19820518,"5/18/82 --4 M1 increased sharply in April, but the expansion was concentrated in the first half of the month and was largely retraced later. Growth of M2 moderated somewhat, owing to a slackening of the expansion in the nontransaction component. Short-term market interest rates and bond yields on balance have declined since the end of March, and mortgage interest rates have edged down further.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that its objectives would be furthered by growth of M1, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively.

19820701,"6/30 - 7/1/82 -3 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP changed little in the second quarter, after the appreciable further decline in the first quarter, as business inventory liquidation moderated from an extraordinary rate. In May the nominal value of retail sales continued to pick up, while industrial production declined only a little further and nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged. The unemployment rate edged up 0.1 percentage point to 9.5 percent. Housing starts rose appreciably from a depressed level.  The price index for gross domestic business product appears to have risen at a relatively slow rate in the second quarter. Over the first five months of this year the producer price index for finished goods was virtually stable, and the advance in the index of average hourly earnings remained at a reduced pace. The consumer price index rose sharply in May, after a small net increase over the preceding four months.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen sharply over the past month, reaching its highest level since early 1971, in response to a rise in U.S. interest rates relative to foreign rates as well as to hostilities in the Middle East. The U.S. foreign trade deficit in the first five months of 1982 was at a rate substantially less than in the fourth quarter of last year, as imports declined more than exports.  M1 declined somewhat in May, after its sharp rise in April, while growth of M2 remained substantial. Business demands for credit, especially short-term credit, were exceptionally strong. Short-term market interest rates and bond yields generally have risen since late May, and mortgage interest rates have increased.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in early February, the Committee agreed that its objectives would be furthered by growth of M1, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. These ranges were under review at this meeting.",,
19820701,"6/30 - 7/1/82 -4 In the short run, the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent with growth of M1 and M2 from June to September at annual rates of about 5 percent and about 9 percent respectively. Somewhat more rapid growth would be acceptable depending on evidence that economic and financial uncertainties are leading to exceptional liquidity demands and changes in financial asset holdings. It was also noted that seasonal uncertainties, together with increased social security payments and the initial impact of the tax cut on cash balances, might lead to a temporary bulge in the monetary aggregates, particularly M1. The Chairman may cali for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 10 to 15 percent.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies and transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period May 18 through June 30, 1982, were ratified.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee would be held on Tuesday, August 24, 1982, at 9:30 a.m.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary",,

The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. At the same time, the Committee agreed that growth in the monetary and credit aggregates around the top of the indicated ranges would be acceptable in the light of the relatively low base period for the M1 target and other factors, and that it would tolerate for some period of time growth somewhat  above the target range should unusual precautionary demands for for money  and liquidity be evident in the light of current economic uncertainties.",,

Gramley, Rice, and Wallich, who had been unable to attend this meeting but who had been present for the main discussion of the longer-run ranges for monetary growth held at the meeting on June 30 July 1, 1982, associated themselves with the Committee in its actions with respect to the ranges for both 1982 and 1983.  Following the Committee's actions, the next to last paragraph of the domestic policy directive adopted at its meeting on June 30-July 1 read as follows:  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.  At its meeting in early February, the Committee had agreed that its objectives would be furthered by growth of M1, M2, and M3 from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 within ranges of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, 6 to 9 percent, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent respectively.

With Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests only a little further advance in real GNP in the current quarter, following a relatively small increase in the second quarter, while prices on the average are continuing to rise more slowly than in 1981. In July the nominal value of retail sales rose somewhat from a sharply reduced June level; housing starts increased substantially, though from a relatively low rate; and industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment were essentially unchanged.  The unemployment rate rose 0.3 percentage point to 9.8 percent. Over the first seven months of the year the advance in the index of average hourly earnings was considerably less rapid than during 1981.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies, while fluctuating over a wide range, has changed little on balance since late June despite a sharp decline in U.S. interest rates relative to foreign rates. Demand for dollars appeared to reflect concern about economic and financial difficulties abroad. The U.S. foreign trade deficit in the second quarter was somewhat below the first-quarter deficit, with petroleum imports down substantially.  M1 declined slightly in June and July, while growth of M2 moderated somewhat from its average pace earlier in the year. Business demands for credit, especially short-term credit, remained generally strong. Market interest rates have declined sharply since around midyear, reflecting a shift in market sentiment about the outlook for interest rates against the background of strains in financial markets, relatively weak economic indicators, and legislative action on the federal budget. The Federal Reserve discount rate was reduced in three steps from 12 percent to 10-1/2 percent during the period.",,

19821005,"10/5/82 -3 With Messrs. Black and Ford and Mrs. Horn dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP changed little in the third quarter, following a small increase in the second quarter, while prices on the average continued to rise more slowly than in 1981. In August the nominal value of retail sales fell back to the sharply reduced June level, while industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment also declined. Housing starts fell, reversing much of the substantial July increase. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 9.8 percent in August, but claims for unemployment insurance have risen further in recent weeks and there are indications of some further decline in production. In recent months the advance in the index of average hourly earnings has remained considerably less rapid than during 1981.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has risen strongly further over the past month, reflecting in part a continuing concern in the market about economic and financial difficulties abroad and also some firming of U.S. interest rates relative to foreign rates after a considerable drop earlier. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit rose sharply in August and on average in July and August the deficit rate was well above that for the first half.  After three months of weakness, M1 grew rapidly in August and September; growth in M2 accelerated in August from an already rapid pace but appears to have slowed markedly in September. Following large declines over the preceding two months, short-term market interest rates have risen somewhat on balance since late August, while bond yields and mortgage rates have continued to decline. The Federal Reserve discount rate was reduced",,
19821005,"10/5/82  -4 from 10-1/2 percent to 10 percent in late August. Meanwhile, reflecting some well-publicized problems in recent months of a few banks here and abroad and the financing difficulties of Mexico, a more cautious atmosphere in private credit markets has been reflected in wider spreads between U.S. government and some private credit instruments.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. In July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 that it had set at the February meeting. These ranges were 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for Ml, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary and credit aggregates around the top of the indicated ranges would be acceptable in the light of the relatively low base period for the M1 target and other factors, and that it would tolerate for some period of time growth somewhat above the target range should unusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity be evident in the light of current economic uncertainties. The Committee also indicated that it was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges for 1983 but that it would review that decision carefully in the light of developments over the remainder of 1982.  Specification of the behavior of M1 over the balance of the year is subject to unusually great uncertainties because it will be substantially affected by special circumstances -—- in the very near term by reinvestment of funds from maturing all savers certificates and later by the public's response to the new account directly competitive with money market funds mandated by recent legislation. The probable difficulties in interpretation of Mil during the period suggest much less than usual weight be placed on movements in that aggregate during the current quarter. These developments are expected to affect M2 and other broader aggregates to a much smaller extent.",,
19821005,"10/5/82 -5 In all the circumstances, the Committee seeks to maintain expansion in bank reserves needed for an orderly and sustained flow of money and credit, consistent with growth of M2 (and M3) in a range of around 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent at an annual rate from September to December, and taking account of the desirability of somewhat reduced pressures in private credit markets in the light of current economic conditions. Somewhat slower growth, bringing those aggregates around the upper part of the ranges set for the year, would be acceptable and desirable in a context of declining interest rates. Should economic and financial uncertainties lead to exceptional liquidity demands, somewhat more rapid growth in the broader aggregates would be tolerated. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 7 to 10-1/2 percent.

In October the nominal value of retail sales edged up, but was little higher than in the second and third quarters; industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment continued to decline; and the unemployment rate rose another 0.3 percentage point to 10.4 percent. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained exceptionally high. In September and the third quarter as a whole, housing starts had strengthened. In recent months the advance in the index of average hourly earnings has remained considerably less rapid than during 1981.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies continued to appreciate from the end of September to mid-November. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit in the third quarter was more than double the rate in the first two quarters of the year.  Growth of M1, already rapid in August and September, accelerated sharply in October in association with the maturing of a large volume of all savers certificates. Growth of M2 and M3 picked up from sluggish rates in September, but remained below the brisk pace of earlier in the year. Most short-term market interest rates have declined on balance since early October, after a reversal in September, and bond yields and mortgage rates have declined further. On October 8 the Federal Reserve announced a reduction in the discount rate from 10 percent to 9-1/2 percent. Quality spreads in the money markets, which had widened, have narrowed in recent weeks as interest rates have declined, and common stock prices have advanced sharply.",,
19821116,"11/16/82 -S The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. In July, the Committee agreed that these objectives would be furthered by reaffirming the monetary growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1981 to the fourth quarter of 1982 that it had set at the February meeting. These ranges were 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent for Ml, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The associated range for bank credit was 6 to 9 percent. The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary and credit aggregates around the top of the indicated ranges would be acceptable in the light of the relatively low base period for the M1 target and other factors, and that it would tolerate for some period of time growth somewhat above the target range should unusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity be evident in the light of current economic uncertainties. The Committee also indicated that it was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges for 1983 but that it would review that decision carefully in the light of developments over the remainder of 1982.  Specification of the behavior of M1 over the balance of the year remains subject to substantial uncertainty because of special circumstances in connection with the reinvestment of funds from maturing all savers certificates and the public's response to the new account directly competitive with money market funds mandated by recent legislation. The difficulties in interpretation of M1 continue to suggest that much less than usual weight be placed on movements in that aggregate during the current quarter.  In all the circumstances, the Committee seeks to maintain expansion in bank reserves needed for an orderly and sustained flow of money and credit, consistent with growth of M2 (and M3) of around 9-1/2 percent at an annual rate from September to December. Somewhat slower growth, bringing those aggregates around the upper part of the ranges set for the year, would be acceptable and desirable in a context of declining interest rates. Should economic and financial uncertainties lead to exceptional liquidity demands, somewhat more rapid growth in the broader aggregates would be tolerated. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.",,

The Committee had also earlier indicated that it was tentatively planning to continue the current ranges for 1983, but it will review that decision carefully at its February 1983 meeting in light of economic developments and institutional changes associated with the new deposit accounts authorized by the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee.  Specification of the behavior of M1 over the months ahead remains subject to substantial uncertainty because of special circumstances in connection with the public's response to the new deposit accounts available at depository institutions.

With Messrs. Black, Ford, Mrs. Horn, and Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Committee established the following longer-run ranges for monetary growth: for the period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2, taking into account the probability of some residual shifting into that aggregate from non-M2 sources; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3, which appears to be less distorted by the new accounts. For the same period a tentative range of 4 to 8 percent has been established for monitoring Ml, assuming that Super NOW accounts draw only modest amounts of funds from sources outside M1 and assuming that the authority to pay interest on transaction balances is not extended beyond presently eligible accounts. An associated range of growth for total domestic nonfinancial debt has been estimated at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent.  With Mr. Ford dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the “following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting indicates  that real GNP declined in the fourth quarter because of a sharp reduction in business inventories, Final sales increased appreciably, and the rise in prices  remained much less rapid than in 1981. Retail sales and housing activity have strengthened in recent months,",,
19830209,"2/8-9/83 -4 but business fixed investment has weakened further. Nonfarm payroll employment rose in January, after an extended period of declines, and the civilian unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage point to 10.4 percent.  In recent months the advance in the index of average hourly earnings has slowed further.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies depreciated moderately further from mid-December to mid-January, but a subsequent appreciation has more than offset that decline. In the fourth quarter the U.S. merchandise trade deficit was close to the relatively high third-quarter rate.  Growth of M2 surged to an extraordinary pace in January, apparently reflecting shifts of funds into recently authorized money market deposit accounts. Growth of M3 accelerated, following very slow expansion in December. Growth of M1 remained rapid in January, although it was down appreciably from the average pace in other recent months. Market interest rates on U.S. Treasury obligations have risen somewhat since the latter part of December, while rates on most private market instruments are about unchanged to slightly higher. Mortgage rates have declined further.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. In establishing growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives, the Committee recognized that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals have been less predictable over the past year; that the current impact of new deposit accounts on growth rates of monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts, declining inflation, and lower market rates of interest may be reflected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity. A substantial shift of funds into M2",,
19830209,"2/8-9/83 -5 from market instruments, including large certificates of deposit not included in M2, in association with the extraordinarily rapid build-up of money market deposit accounts has distorted growth in that aggregate during the current quarter.  In establishing growth ranges for the aggregates for 1983 against this background, the Committee felt that growth in M2 might be more appropriately measured after the period of highly aggressive marketing of money market deposit accounts has subsided. The Committee also felt that a somewhat wider range was appropriate for monitoring Ml. Those growth ranges will be reviewed in the spring and altered, if appropriate, in the light of evidence at that time.  With these understandings, the Committee established the following growth ranges: for the period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983,  7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2, taking into account the probability of some residual shifting into that aggregate from non-M2 sources; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3, which appears to be less distorted by the new accounts. For the same period a tentative range of 4 to 8 percent has been established for Ml, assuming that Super NOW accounts draw only modest amounts of funds from sources outside M1 and assuming that the authority to pay interest on transaction balances is not extended beyond presently eligible accounts. An associated range of growth for total domestic nonfinancial debt has been estimated at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent.  In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would be placed on behavior of the broader monetary aggregates, expecting that current distortions in M2 from the initial adjustment to the new deposit accounts will abate. The behavior of M1 will be monitored, with the degree of weight placed on that aggregate over time dependent on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predictable patterns. Debt expansion, while not directly targeted, will be evaluated in judging responses to the monetary aggregates. The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.",,

In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U. S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.  3.

S. Government securities to such foreign and international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph 1(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in",,

By unanimous vote, the Resolution of Federal Open Market Committee Authorizing Certain Actions by Federal Reserve Banks During an Emergency was amended to read as follows:  RESOLUTION OF FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE AUTHORIZING CERTAIN ACTIONS BY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS DURING AN EMERGENCY Amended March 28, 1983  The Federal Open Market Committee hereby authorizes each Federal Reserve Bank to take any or all of the actions set forth below during war or defense emergency when such Federal Reserve Bank finds itself unable after reasonable efforts to be in communication with the Federal Open Market Committee (or with the Interim Committee acting in lieu of the Federal Open Market Committee) or when the Federal Open Market Committee (or such Interim Committee) is unable to function.  (1) Whenever it deems it necessary in the light of economic conditions and the general credit situation then prevailing (after taking into account the possibility of providing necessary credit through advances secured by direct obligations of the United States under the last paragraph of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act), such Federal Reserve Bank may purchase and sell obligations of the United States for its own account, either outright or under repurchase agreement, from and to banks, dealers or other holders of such obligations.  (2) Such Federal Reserve Bank may engage in operations of the types specified in the Committee's authorization for System foreign currency operations when requested to do so by an authorized official of the U.S. Treasury Department; provided, however, that such Bank shall take all steps practicable at the time to insure as far as possible that, in light of the information available on other System foreign currency operations, its own operations do not result in the aggregate in breaching any of the several dollar limits specified in the authorization.  Authority to take the actions set forth shall be effective only until such time as the Federal Reserve Bank is able again to establish communications with the Federal Open Market Committee (or the Interim Committee), and such Committee is then functioning.",,

19830329,"3/28-29/83 -16 By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 8-9, 1983, were approved.  Renewal for further periods of three months of drawings on the System by the Bank of Mexico maturing April 9 through May 27, 1983, was noted without objection.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period February 9 through March 28, 1983, were ratified.  Secretary's Note: All of the above actions were taken on Monday, March 28, 1983.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP rose moderately in the first quarter, after a decline in the fourth quarter; the turnaround reflects a considerable slowing in inventory liquidation. Private final sales apparently increased only slightly less than in the fourth quarter with housing activity strengthening further. Business fixed investment has remained weak. Nonfarm payroll employment rose on balance in January and February, after an extended period of declines; the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 10.4 percent. In early 1983 the rise in average prices and the advance in the index of average hourly earnings have slowed further.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose somewhat on balance between early February and late March. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit declined marginally in January.  M2 continued to grow at an exceptional rate in February and M3 also expanded at a rapid pace, but growth in both of the broader aggregates appears to be decelerating substantially in March. The deceleration reflects in part the marked slowing in growth of money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) in recent weeks and apparently also a moderation in the underlying",,
19830329,"3/28-29/83 -17 growth of these aggregates, abstracting from shifts from market instruments. M1 has expanded rapidly since late January, largely reflecting accelerated growth in NOW accounts. Growth in debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have been moderate  in the first quarter. Short-term interest rates have risen somewhat since early February while long-term rates, including mortgage rates, have declined.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote a resumption of growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in February the Committee established growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives. The Committee recognized that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals have been less predictable over the past year; that the current impact of new deposit accounts on growth rates of monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts, declining inflation, and lower market rates of interest may be reflected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity. A substantial shift of funds into M2 from market instruments, including large certificates of deposit not included in M2, in association with the extraordinarily rapid build-up of money market deposit accounts, has distorted growth in that aggregate during the first quarter.  In establishing growth ranges for the aggregates for 1983 against this background, the Committee felt that growth in M2 might be more appropriately measured after the period of highly aggressive marketing of money market deposit accounts has subsided. The Committee also felt that a somewhat wider range was appropriate for monitoring Ml. Those growth ranges will be reviewed in the spring and altered, if appropriate, in the light of evidence at that time.  With these understandings, the Committee established the following growth ranges: for the period from FebruaryMarch of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2, taking into account the",,
19830329,"3/28-29/83 -18 probability of some residual shifting into that aggregate from non-M2 sources; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3, which appeared to be less distorted by the new accounts. For the same period a tentative range of 4 to 8 percent was established for Ml, assuming that Super NOW accounts would draw only modest amounts  of funds from sources outside M1 and assuming that the authority to pay interest on transaction balances is not extended beyond presently eligible accounts. An associated range of growth for total domestic nonfinancial debt was estimated at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent.  In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would be placed on behavior of the broader monetary aggregates, expecting that distortions in M2 from the initial adjustment to the new deposit accounts will abate. The behavior of M1 will be monitored, with the degree of weight placed on that aggregate over time dependent on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predictable patterns. Debt expansion, while not directly targeted, will be evaluated in judging responses to the monetary aggregates. The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  For the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain generally the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions, anticipating that would be consistent with a slowing from March to June in growth of M2 and M3 to annual rates of about 9 and 8 percent, respectively.  The Committee expects that M1 growth at an annual rate of about 6 to 7 percent would be consistent with its objectives for the broader aggregates. Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in the monetary aggregates relative  to the paths implied by the long-term ranges (taking account of the distortions relating to the introduction of new accounts), or indications of a weakening in the pace of economic recovery. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of  6 to 10 percent.",,

19830524,"5/24/83 -3 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real GNP has accelerated in the current quarter following a moderate increase in the first quarter. Industrial production increased sharply in April after rising at a moderate pace-in previous months; nonfarm payroll employment and retail sales rose considerably in March and April. Housing starts declined somewhat in both months but were still well above depressed 1982 levels. Data on new orders and shipments suggest that the demand for business equipment is reviving. The civilian unemployment rate edged down to 10.2 percent in April. Average prices have changed little and the index of average hourly earnings has risen at a much reduced pace in the early months of 1983.  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has remained in a narrow range near its recent high level since late March. The U.S. foreign trade deficit fell substantially in the first quarter, reflecting a sharp drop in the value of oil imports.  Growth in M2 and M3 decelerated further in April to relatively low rates but appears to have picked up recently. M1 declined in April but has strengthened markedly in early May. Growth in debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have been moderate over the first four months of the year. Interest rates have changed little on balance since late March.

19830713,"7/12-13/83 -3With Mr. Morris dissenting, the Committee voted for the following longer-run policy:  The Committee reaffirmed the longer-run ranges established earlier for growth in M2 and M3 for 1983. The Committee also agreed on tentative growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The Committee considered that growth in M1 in a range of 5 to 9 percent from the second quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983 and in a range of 4 to 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 would be consistent with the ranges for the broader aggregates. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent for 1983 and tentatively set at 8 to 11 percent for 1984.  With Mrs. Teeters and Mr. Wallich dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The rapid growth in real GNP in the second quarter and other information reviewed at this meeting suggest that the economic recovery is proceeding at a strengthened pace. Expenditures on consumption and housing expanded substantially in the second quarter and businesses apparently began to add to inventories after a period of sharp liquidation. Nonfarm payroll employment rose considerably in May and June and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 10.0 percent in June. Industrial production continued to rise markedly in May and partial data suggest a sizable gain in June. Data on new orders and shipments continued to indicate improvement in the demand for business equipment. In May housing starts increased substantially following small declines earlier and retail sales rose appreciably further. Average prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen at a reduced pace in the first five months of 1983,  The weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose substantially in late May and the first half of June and subsequently has fluctuated in a narrow range. Reflecting the strength of the U.S. economy and the persistent high",,
19830713,"7/12-13/83 -4 level of the dollar, the U.S. foreign trade deficit increased sharply in April-May from its reduced first-quarter rate; exports declined and both oil and nonoil imports rose.  Strong growth in the broader aggregates in May and June raised M2 to a level somewhat above the midpoint of the Committee's range for 1983 and M3 to around the upper limit of its range. M1 grew very rapidly over both months and was well above its range for the year. Growth in debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have picked up in the second quarter. Interest rates have risen appreciably since early May.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in February the Committee established growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives. The Committee recognized that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals have been less predictable over the past year; that the impact of new deposit accounts on growth ranges of monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts, declining inflation, and lower market rates of interest may be reflected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity.  In establishing growth ranges last February for the aggregates for 1983 against this background, the Committee felt that growth in M2 might be more appropriately measured after the period of highly aggressive marketing of money market deposit accounts had subsided. The Committee also felt that a somewhat wider range was appropriate for monitoring Ml. With these understandings, the Committee established the following growth ranges: for the period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2, taking into account the probability of some residual shifting into that aggregate from non-M2 sources; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3, which appeared to be less distorted by the new accounts. For the same period a tentative range of 4 to 8 percent was established for M1 assuming that Super NOW accounts would draw only modest amounts of funds from sources outside M1 and assuming that the authority to pay interest on transaction balances",,
19830713,"7/12-13/83 -5 was not extended beyond presently eligible accounts. An associated range of growth for total domestic nonfinancial debt was estimated at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent. These ranges were reviewed at the May meeting and left unchanged, pending further review in July.  At this meeting, the Committee reaffirmed the longer-run ranges established earlier for growth in M2 and M3 for 1983. The Committee also agreed on tentative growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The Committee considered that growth in M1 in a range of 5 to 9 percent from the second quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, and in a range of 4 to 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 would be consistent with the ranges for the broader aggregates. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent for 1983 and tentatively set at 8 to 11 percent for 1984.  In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would continue to be placed on the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates. The behavior of M1 and total domestic nonfinancial debt will be monitored, with the degree of weight placed on M1 over time dependent on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predictable patterns. The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  The Committee seeks in the short run to increase slightly further the existing degree of reserve restraint. The action is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of about 8-1/2 and 8 percent respectively from June to September, consistent with the targets established for these aggregates for the year. Depending on evidence about the strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a significant shortfall in growth of the aggregates from current expectations, while somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly. The Committee anticipates that a deceleration in M1 growth to an annual rate of around 7 percent from June to September will be consistent with its third-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt would remain within the range established for the year.

Industrial production increased sharply in July following large gains in the second quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment also rose substantially further in July and the civilian unemployment rate declined 1/2 percentage point to 9.5 percent. After rising sharply in the spring, retail sales have leveled off recently. Housing starts edged down over the past two months but permits continued to rise, Recent data on new orders and shipments on average continued to indicate strength in the demand for business equipment. In July, information on producer and consumer prices and the index of average hourly earnings was consistent with earlier indications of a considerable moderation in the rate of inflation.  Growth in the broader monetary aggregates slowed substantially in July, bringing M2 to a level near the midpoint of the Committee's range for 1983 and M3 to a level somewhat below the upper limit of its range. Growth in M1 decelerated considerably from its MayJune pace, but its level remained above the Committee's monitoring range for the year. Interest rates rose appreciably through much of the intermeeting period but recently market rates have retraced most of their rise.  In part reflecting the course of U.S. interest rates, the weighted average value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose substantially further in July and early August, but the rise was followed by a subsequent decline that reversed most of the earlier increase. The U.S. foreign trade deficit was smaller in June than in May, but the deficit in the second quarter was much larger than in the first as imports rose while exports were essentially unchanged.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions.

19831004,"10/4/83 -3- The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP continued to grow rapidly in the third quarter, although the rate of expansion moderated from that in the second quarter. Industrial production and employment increased appreciably further in August, following large gains in previous months, and the civilian unemployment rate remained at 9.5 percent. After rising sharply in the spring, growth in consumer spending has moderated substantially. Housing starts rose in August but permits turned down. Data on new orders and shipments generally continued to indicate strength in the demand for business equipment. Producer and consumer prices increased somewhat more in August  ' than in other recent months, but over the first eight months of the year average prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen more slowly than in 1982.  After slowing substantially in July, growth in M2 remained at a reduced pace over the August-September period, while expansion in M3 picked up. Through September M2 is estimated to be at a level in the lower portion of the Committee's range for 1983 and M3 in the upper portion of its range. Growth in M1 decelerated considerably further in August-September and moved within the Committee's monitoring range for the second half of the year. Interest rates have declined somewhat since mid-August.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar, as measured by its weighted average value against major foreign currencies, has fluctuated within a relatively narrow range since mid-August. The U.S. foreign trade deficit rose substantially in July-August from the second-quarter rate, reflecting a further increase in imports of a broad range of goods.

The U.S. foreign trade deficit increased considerably in the third quarter, with imports, especially of petroleum, rising faster than exports.  After slowing substantially over the summer months, growth in M2 accelerated in October, while M3 continued to expand at a moderate rate. Through October M2 was at a level in the lower portion of the Committee's range for 1983 and M3 in the upper portion of its range.

Given the relatively slow growth in October, the Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual rate of around 5 to 6 percent from September to December will be consistent with its fourth-quarter objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt would remain within the range established for the year. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.

With Mr. Martin dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP has grown at a relatively rapid pace in the current quarter, although the rate of expansion appears to have moderated since the spring and summer. In November, industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably further and the civilian unemployment rate declined 0.4 percentage point to 8.4 percent. Retail sales rose substantially in November following sizable gains in September and October. Housing starts increased in November to a level close to their third-quarter average. Recent data indicate continuing expansion in business capital spending. Producer prices were little changed on average in October and November, and consumer prices continued to increase in October at about the same pace as in other recent months. The index of average hourly earnings changed little in November after rising somewhat faster in September and October than in previous months; over the first eleven months of the year the index has risen more slowly than in 1982.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar has risen considerably further since mid-November against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies. In October the U.S. foreign trade deficit was markedly higher than in the third quarter, reflecting a sharp rise in imports.  After slowing substantially over the summer months, growth in M2 and M3 strengthened in October and November. M1 continued to grow at a sluggish pace in November but increased substantially in early December. Through",,
19831220,"12/19-20/83 aha  November, M2 was at a level in the lower portion of the Committee's range for 1983, M3 was close to the upper limit of its range, and M1 was near the lower end of the Committee's monitoring range for the second half  of the year. Most interest rates have risen somewhat since mid-November.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to a sustainable pattern of international transactions. At its meeting in July the Committee reconsidered the growth ranges for monetary and credit aggregates established earlier for 1983 in furtherance of these objectives and set tentative ranges for 1984. The Committee recognized that the relationships between such ranges and ultimate economic goals have become less predictable; that the impact of new deposit accounts on growth of monetary aggregates cannot be determined with a high degree of confidence; and that the availability of interest on large portions of transaction accounts may be reflected in some changes in the historical trends in velocity.  Against this background, the Committee at its July meeting reaffirmed the following growth ranges for the broader aggregates: for the period from February-March of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 7 to 10 percent at an annual rate for M2; and for the period from the fourth quarter of 1982 to the fourth quarter of 1983, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. The Committee also agreed on tentative growth ranges for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984 of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M2 and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The Committee considered that growth of M1 in a range of 5 to 9 percent from the second quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1983, and in a range of 4 to 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984, would be consistent with the ranges for the broader aggregates. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was reaffirmed at 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent for 1983 and tentatively set at 8 to 11 percent for 1984,",,
19831220,"12/19-20/83 -5 In implementing monetary policy, the Committee agreed that substantial weight would continue to be placed on the behavior of the broader monetary aggregates. The behavior of M1 and total domestic nonfinancial debt will be monitored, with the degree of weight placed on M1 over time dependent on evidence that velocity characteristics are resuming more predictable patterns. The Committee understood that policy implementation would involve continuing appraisal of the relationships between the various measures of money and credit and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  The Committee seeks in the short run to maintain at least the existing degree of reserve restraint. The action is expected to be associated with growth of M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 8 percent from November to March. The Committee anticipates that M1 growth at an annual rate of around 6 percent from November to March will be consistent with its objectives for the broader aggregates, and that expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt would continue at around its recent pace. Depending on evidence about the continuing strength of economic recovery and other factors bearing on the business and inflation outlook, somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.

19840131,"1/30-31/84 -3 With Mr. Morris dissenting, the Committee voted for the following longer-run policy:  The Committee established growth ranges for the broader aggregates of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The Committee also considered that a range of 4 to 8 percent for M1 would be appropriate for the same period, taking account of the possibility that, in the light of the changed composition of M1, its relationship to GNP over time may be shifting. Pending further experience, growth in that aggregate will need to be interpreted in the light of the growth in the other monetary aggregates, which for the time being would continue to receive substantial weight. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 1l percent for the year 1984.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that the advance in real GNP moderated in the fourth quarter, following rapid expansion in the spring and summer. In December, industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment increased somewhat further and the civilian unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage point to 8.2 percent. Retail sales were reported to have changed little in December following sizable gains in preceding months. Housing starts declined in December but for the fourth quarter as a whole were close to their average for the year. Recent data indicate substantial strength in business capital spending. Producer prices were about unchanged on average in November and December, and consumer prices increased at about the moderate pace recorded for the year as a whole. The index of average hourly earnings rose somewhat faster in the fourth quarter than in the previous quarter, but for the year 1983 the index increased more slowly than in 1982.",,
19840131,"1/30-31/84 -4 The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has appreciated somewhat further since the latter part of December, with most of the rise occurring in early January. In the fourth quarter the U.S. foreign trade deficit was markedly higher than in the third quarter, reflecting a sharp rise in non-oil imports.  M2 and M3 have expanded at moderate rates over the past two months. Expansion in M1 apparently accelerated in January, following several months of reduced growth. By the fourth quarter M2 was at a level close to the midpoint of the Committee's range for 1983, M3 was around the upper limit of its range, and M1 was around the middle of the Committee's monitoring range for the second half of the year. Most interest rates have declined somewhat since the latter part of December.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. The Committee established growth ranges for the broader aggregates of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984, The Committee also considered that a range of 4 to 8 percent for M1 would be appropriate for the same period, taking account of the possibility that, in the light of the changed composition of M1, its relationship to GNP over time may be shifting.

19840131,"1/30-31/84 -5 In the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on bank reserve positions, anticipating that approach will be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 each at annual rates of about 8 percent and M1 at an annual rate of about 7 percent during the period from December to March. Growth in nonfinancial debt is expected to be within the range established for the year. Lesser restraint would be acceptable in the context of a shortfall in monetary and credit growth from current expectations, while somewhat greater restraint might be acceptable with more rapid expansion of the aggregates, both viewed in the context of the strength of the business expansion and inflationary pressures.  In implementing policy in the weeks ahead, the Manager was instructed to take account of the uncertainties associated with the introduction of the system of more contemporaneous reserve requirements, particularly including the possibility that depository institutions, during a transition period, may desire to hold more excess reserves.

By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations shown below was reaffirmed:  AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS Reaffirmed March 26, 1984  1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:  (a) To buy or sell U. S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U. S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of U. S. Government and Federal agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments) at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased or decreased by more than $4.0 billion during the period commencing with the opening of business on the day following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting;  (b) When appropriate, to buy or sell in the open market, from or to acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at market discount rates, prime bankers acceptances with maturities of up to nine months at the time of acceptance that (1) arise out of the current shipment of",,
19840327,"3/26-27/84 -u goods between countries or within the United States, or (2) arise out  of the storage within the United States of goods under contract of sale or expected to move into the channels of trade within a reasonable time and that are secured throughout their life by a warehouse receipt or similar document conveying title to the underlying goods; provided that the aggregate amount of bankers acceptances held at any one time shall not exceed $100 million;  (c) To buy U. S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, and prime bankers acceptances of the types authorized for purchase under 1(b) above, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities, obligations, or acceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account; and provided further that in the event bankers acceptances covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the seller, they shall continue to be held by the Federal Reserve Bank or shall be sold in the open market.  2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U. S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.  3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U. S. Government securities to such foreign and international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph 1(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph 1(c), repurchase agreements in U. S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.",,

By unanimous vote, the Committee agreed to discontinue use of repurchase agreements on bankers’ acceptances in conducting open market operations. The effective date of this action is July 2, 1984.  By unanimous vote, the Committee adopted a program for safeguarding confidential FOMC information.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on January 30-31, 1984, were approved.  By unanimous vote, paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $4 billion to $6 billion the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities effective March 28 through the close of business on May 22, 1984,  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period January 31 through March 26, 1984, were ratified.  Secretary's Note: All of the above actions were taken on Monday, March 26, 1984.

19840327,"3/26-27/84 -13 The information reviewed at this meeting indicates that growth in real GNP has accelerated markedly in the current quarter and suggests that demand for goods and services may remain relatively strong in the months ahead. In January and February, industrial production rose at a considerably faster pace than in the fourth quarter, and gains in nonfarm payroll employment were large over the two-month period. The civilian unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage point each month to 7.8 percent in February. Retail sales grew at an exceptional pace in January and changed little in February. Housing starts rose substantially in both months to the highest rate in several years. Information on outlays and spending plans generally suggests continuing strength in business fixed investment. Prices rose somewhat faster in early 1984 than in the fourth quarter, with increases concentrated in the food sector. The index of average hourly earnings rose only slightly over the first two months of the year, although total compensation costs appear to have increased more rapidly.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies declined considerably from the end of January through the first week of March, but part of that decline was retraced more recently. The merchandise trade deficit rose sharply in January, mainly because of larger non-oil imports.  Data available through mid-March indicate that M1 and M3 have expanded somewhat more rapidly than anticipated at the previous meeting; since the fourth quarter of 1983, M1 and M3 are tentatively estimated to have grown at rates close to the upper limits of the Committee's ranges for 1984, Growth in M2 appears to have been less rapid than previously expected and was estimated to be at a rate in the lower part of its longer-run range. In January and February, growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt apparently rose at a pace substantially above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, and bank credit continued to expand at a relatively rapid rate. Interest rates have risen considerably since late January.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved",,
19840327,"3/26-27/84 -14 pattern of international transactions. The Committee established growth ranges for the broader aggregates of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984, The Committee also considered that a range of 4 to 8 percent for M1 would be appropriate for the same period, taking account of the possibility that, in the light of the changed composition of M1, its relationship to GNP over time may be shifting. Pending further experience, growth in that aggregate will need to be interpreted in the light of the growth in the other monetary aggregates, which for the time being would continue to receive substantial weight. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the short run the Committee seeks to maintain pressures on bank reserve positions judged to be consistent with growth in Ml, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 6-1/2, 8, and 8-1/2 percent, respectively, during the period from March to June. Greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates, while somewhat lesser restraint might be acceptable if growth of the monetary aggregates slowed significantly; in either case, such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the continuing strength of the business expansion, inflationary pressures and the rate of credit growth.  The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent.

With Mr. Boykin dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that growth in real GNP, while moderating from the unusually strong first-quarter pace, remains relatively rapid in the current quarter. In April, industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially following decreased growth in March; the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.8 percent in March and April as the labor force increased",,
19840522,"5/21-22/84 -3 appreciably. Retail sales grew rapidly in April after two months of decline, and housing starts recovered  to a rate equaling their first-quarter average. Information on outlays and spending plans generally suggests continuing strength in business fixed investment. Since the beginning of the year, prices and wages have continued to rise at about the same pace as in 1983.  M1 changed little in April on average, but data available for early May suggest a considerable strengthening. In April M2 grew about in line with expectations while M3 expanded more rapidly than anticipated. From the fourth quarter of 1983 through April, M1 grew at a rate a little below the midpoint of the Committee's range for 1984; M2 increased at a rate in the lower part of its longer-run range, while M3 expanded at a rate a bit above the upper limit of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt apparently is growing at a pace above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, with borrowing by businesses continuing to be concentrated in the short-term markets. Interest rates have risen considerably further since late March. On April 6, the Federal Reserve announced an increase in the discount rate from 8-1/2 to 9 percent. Recently, day-to-day market conditions have reflected considerable sensitivity to potential liquidity strains, as highlighted by problems of one large bank, and to uncertainties about the financial and budgetary outlook generally.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has risen considerably further since late March to a level close to the peak in early January. The merchandise trade deficit widened further in the first quarter, as a sharp rise in non-oil imports offset a substantial rise in exports.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. The Committee established growth ranges for the broader aggregates of 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter",,

Pending further experience, growth in that aggregate will need to be interpreted in the light of the growth in the other monetary aggregates, which for the time being would continue to receive substantial weight.

By unanimous vote, the following longer-run policy for 1985 was adopted by the Committee:  For 1985 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges  of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, of 4 to 7 percent for Ml, 6 to 8-1/2 percent for M2, and  6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent.

19840717,"7/16-17/84 -4 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is continuing at a strong pace, but there are indications of moderation in some sectors. In May and June, industrial production and retail sales expanded further, though at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in both months and the civilian unemployment rate fell to 7.1 percent in June. Housing starts declined in May to a rate appreciably below the average in the first four months of 1984. Information on outlays and spending plans continues to suggest strength in business fixed investment. Since the beginning of the year, average prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen more slowly than in 1983.  M1 grew rapidly in May and June after having changed little in April, while M2 continued to expand moderately. M3 growth slowed somewhat in June but was relatively strong over the second quarter. From the fourth quarter of 1983 through June, M1 grew at a rate somewhat below the upper limit of the Committee's range for 1984; M2 increased at a rate a little below the midpoint of its longer-run range, while M3 expanded at a rate above the upper limit of its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to grow in the second quarter at a pace above the Committee's. monitoring range for the year, reflecting very large government borrowing along with strong private credit growth. Interest rates have fluctuated considerably since the May meeting of the Committee. Financial markets were affected by concerns arising from international debt problems. On balance, rates on private short-term securities rose further, while rates on Treasury bills were about unchanged; in long-term debt markets, rates on most private obligations changed little while those on Treasury bonds declined.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has risen considerably further since mid-May to a level above its peak in early January.

In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at the July meeting to reaffirm the ranges for monetary growth that it had established in January: 4 to 8 percent for M1 and 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was also reaffirmed at 8 to 11 percent for the year 1984, It was anticipated that M3 and nonfinancial debt might increase at rates somewhat above the upper limits of their 1984 ranges, given developments in the first half of the year, but the Committee felt that higher target ranges would provide inappropriate benchmarks for evaluating longer-term trends in M3 and credit growth. For 1985 the Committee agreed on tentative ranges of monetary growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, of 4 to 7 percent for Ml, 6 to 8-1/2 percent for M2, and 6 to 9 percent for M3. The associated range for nonfinancial debt was set at 8 to 11 percent.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committee seeks to maintain existing pressures on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1 at an annual rate of around 5 percent or slightly less, and in M2 and M3 at annual rates of around 7-1/2 and 9 percent respectively during the period from June to September. Somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates, while somewhat lesser restraint would be acceptable in the event of significantly slower growth. In either case, such a change would be considered only in the context of appraisals of the continuing strength of the business expansion, inflationary pressures, financial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth.

By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities and agency obligations during the period August 21 through October 1, 1984, were ratified. With Messrs. Martin and Rice and Ms. Seger dissenting, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity slowed appreciably in the third quarter from a strong pace earlier  in the year. In August, industrial production rose only slightly and gains in nonfarm payroll employment",,

Information on outlays and spending plans suggests slower expansion in business fixed investment, following exceptionally rapid growth in recent quarters. Since the beginning of the year, average prices and the index of average hourly earnings have risen more slowly than  in 1983.  In August the monetary aggregates expanded at relatively slow rates, but data available for September suggested some strengthening. From the fourth quarter of 1983 through September, M1 apparently grew at a rate close to the midpoint of the Committee's range for 1984, M2 at a rate somewhat below the midpoint of its longer-run range, and M3 at a rate near the upper limit of its range. Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be continuing at a pace above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, reflecting large government borrowing along with relatively strong private credit growth. Interest rates generally have fallen somewhat further since the August meeting of the Committee.  Over the past month, the foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has fluctuated widely under often volatile market conditions, reaching a new high in the latter part of September; since then the dollar has declined somewhat. The merchandise trade deficit rose sharply to a record high rate in the July-August period.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at the July meeting to reaffirm the ranges for monetary growth that it had established in January: 4 to 8 percent for M1 and 6 to 9 percent for both M2 and M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984.

This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 6, 7-1/2, and 9 percent, respectively, during the period from September to December. A somewhat further lessening of restraint on reserve positions would be acceptable in the event of significantly slower growth in the monetary aggregates, evaluated in relation to the strength of business expansion and inflationary pressures, domestic and international financial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth.

Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially  outside of manufacturing in October, following a moderate increase in September, and the civilian unemployment",,
19841107,"11/7/84  -4 rate was unchanged at 7.4 percent. Industrial production fell in September, partly because of strikes, and available information suggests little increase  in October. Retail sales and housing starts rebounded in September after two months of decline. Information on outlays and spending plans suggests slower expansion in business fixed investment, following exceptionally rapid growth earlier, and inventory investment, having risen relative to sales in  recent months, also appears to be slowing. Since  the beginning of the year, broad measures of prices generally have continued to rise at rates close to,  or somewhat above, those recorded in 1983, and the index of average hourly earnings has risen somewhat more slowly.  Growth of the monetary aggregates strengthened in September, but data available for October indicated that M1 declined during the month, growth of M2 slowed somewhat, and expansion of M3 picked up further. From the fourth quarter of 1983 through October, M1 grew at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's range for 1984, M2 at a rate somewhat below the midpoint of its longer-run range, and M3 at a rate a bit above the upper limit of its range. Growth in total domestic nonfinancial debt appears to be continuing above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, reflecting large government borrowing; private credit growth, though relatively strong, has moderated in recent months. Interest rates have fallen substantially further since the meeting of the Committee on October 2.  Over the past month, the foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has continued to fluctuate widely, rising to a new high in mid-October but subsequently declining to somewhat below its level at the time of the previous meeting. The merchandise trade deficit in the third quarter was substantially above the first-half rate as a sharp rise in non-oil imports exceeded some further growth in exports.

Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further outside of manufacturing in November, and the civilian unemployment rate fell from 7.4 to 7.2 percent. After two months of decline industrial production increased somewhat in November, largely reflecting a rebound in auto production from strike-reduced levels. Retail sales registered a large gain in November after changing little in October. Information on outlays suggests substantially slower expansion in business fixed investment, following exceptionally rapid growth earlier. Since the beginning of the year, broad measures of prices generally have continued to rise at rates close to, or somewhat above, those recorded in 1983, and the index of average hourly earnings has risen somewhat more slowly.  Growth of the monetary aggregates strengthened markedly in November. The November expansion in M1 offset the decline in October, and this aggregate has grown little on balance since early summer; from the fourth quarter of 1983 through November, M1 grew at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's range for 1984. Growth in the broader aggregates was especially rapid in November, bringing M2 to the midpoint of its longer-run range and M3 a bit further above the upper limit of its range. Expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt is continuing above the Committee's monitoring range for the year, reflecting very large government borrowing and strong private credit growth. Interest rates have fallen further since the November meeting of the Committee, with the largest declines concentrated in short-term markets.

Boehne, Martin, and Wallich dissenting, the Committee  voted for the following longer-run policy:  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at this meeting to establish ranges for monetary growth of 4 to 7 percent for Ml, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 9 to 12 percent for the year 1985.  The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary aggregates in the upper part of their ranges for 1985 may be appropriate, depending on developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following  domestic policy directive:",,
19850213,"2/12-13/85 -4 The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP expanded at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter, reflecting some strengthening in late 1984 after several months of considerably reduced growth, and there was evidence of continued moderate expansion in early 1985. Total retail sales rose in January at about the same pace as the average for November and December, while the decline in housing starts appears to have ended. Industrial production and nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably in the November-December period and nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in January. The civilian unemployment rate rose slightly in January to 7.4 percent. Information on business spending suggests less rapid expansion in outlays for fixed investment, following exceptional growth earlier; businesses also appear to have made substantial progress in adjusting their inventories. During 1984 broad measures of prices generally increased at rates close to those recorded in 1983, and the index of average hourly earnings rose somewhat more slowly.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar against a trade-weighted average of major foreign currencies has continued to appreciate strongly since mid-December.  After the announcement on January 17 by the G--5 Ministers  of Finance and Central Bank Governors regarding coordinated intervention in exchange markets, and subsequent operations, the dollar's rise moderated somewhat. The merchandise trade deficit declined sharply in December and for the fourth quarter as a whole, primarily because of a large drop in imports from the high rate in the third quarter. Nevertheless, the deficit for the full year 1984 was substantially higher than in 1983.  After growing little on balance since early summer, M1 expanded at a rapid pace in late 1984 and early 1985. The broader aggregates also expanded rapidly in recent months. For the period from the fourth quarter of 1983 to the fourth quarter of 1984, M1 grew at a rate of about 5-1/4 percent, somewhat below the midpoint of the Committee's range for the year, and M2 increased at a rate of about 7-3/4 percent, a bit above the midpoint of its longer-run range. Both M3 and total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at rates above the Committee's ranges for the",,
19850213,"2/12-13/85 -5 year, reflecting very large government borrowing and strong private credit growth, boosted in part by the unusual size of merger-related credit activity. Short-term interest rates have risen somewhat on balance since the December meeting of the Committee, but long-term rates are about unchanged to a little lower. On December 21, the Federal Reserve approved a reduction in the discount rate from 8-1/2 to 8 percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions. In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at this meeting to establish ranges for monetary growth of 4 to 7 percent for Ml, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985. The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 9 to 12 percent for the year 1985. The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary aggregates in the upper part of their ranges for 1985 may be appropriate, depending on developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.  The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit but also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, taking account of the progress against inflation, remaining uncertainties in the business outlook, and the strength of the dollar in the exchange markets, the Committee seeks to maintain reserve conditions characteristic of recent weeks. Should growth in M1 appear to be exceeding an annual rate of around 8 percent and M2 and M3 a rate of around 10 to 11 percent during the period from December to March, modest increases in reserve pressures would be sought, particularly if business activity is rising at a satisfactory rate and exchange market pressures diminish. Lesser restraint on reserve positions would be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth in the monetary aggregates, particularly in the context of sluggish growth",,

The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, March 26, 1985.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary",,

The Manager for Foreign Operations shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System, and about any operations that are not of a routine character.  By unanimous vote, paragraph l(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $4 billion to $6 billion the limit on intermeeting changes in System account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities. With this amendment, the authorization reads  as follows:  AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS Amended March 26, 1985  1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:  (a) To buy or sell U. S. Government securities, including securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U. S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement; provided that the aggregate amount of U. S. Government and Federal agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments) at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive shall not be increased or decreased by more than $6.0 billion during the period commencing with the opening of business on the day following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the day of the next such meeting;",,

S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, and prime bankers acceptances of the types authorized for purchase under 1(b) above, from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under agreements for repurchase of such securities, obligations, or acceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the event Government securities or agency issues covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred to the System Open Market Account; and provided further that in the event bankers acceptances covered by any such agreement are not repurchased by the seller, they shall continue to be held by the Federal Reserve Bank or shall be sold in the open market.  2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U. S. Government securities held in the System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as the Committee may specify from time to time.  3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U. S. Government securities to such foreign and international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph 1(a) under agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers,",,
19850326,"3/26/85 -12 subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in paragraph l(c), repurchase agreements in U. S. Government and agency securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between its own account and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.  By unanimous vote, the minutes of actions taken at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 12-13, 1985, were approved.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in Government securities, agency obligations, and bankers acceptances during the period February 13 through March 25, 1985, were ratified.  By unanimous vote, System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 13 through March 25, 1985 were ratified.  By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until otherwise directed by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that real GNP is currently expanding at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter, with an increased share of domestic spending apparently being met out of imports. Total retail sales rose considerably for January and February combined and housing starts, though declining in February, were above their fourth-quarter pace. However, information on business capital spending suggests less rapid expansion in early 1985. Business inventory investment continues at a moderate rate. Industrial production declined on balance in January and February and, with employment falling in the manufacturing sector, total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a somewhat reduced pace. The civilian unemployment rate, at 7.3 percent in February, was little changed from its level at year-end. Broad measures of prices and the index of average hourly earnings appear to be continuing to rise at rates close to those recorded in 1984.",,
19850326,"3/26/85  -13 Since the Committee's meeting in mid-February, the foreign exchange value of the dollar has fluctuated widely in often volatile market conditions. Most recently, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against major foreign currencies has dropped sharply, more than offsetting its rise earlier in the intermeeting interval. Monetary authorities sold dollars on a large scale during the period, especially in late February and early March. The merchandise trade deficit increased sharply in January from relatively low December and fourth-quarter rates. The current account deficit for the full year 1984 was more than double that recorded in 1983,  Growth in M1 accelerated in February, following relatively rapid expansion in other recent months, but information available through mid-March indicates a considerable slowing. Growth in the broader aggregates moderated in February and appears to be slowing further in March. In January and February expansion in total domestic nonfinancial debt remained relatively rapid, though somewhat below the pace of previous months.  Most interest rates have risen somewhat since the February meeting of the Committee.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks to foster monetary and financial conditions that will help to reduce inflation further, promote growth in output on a sustainable basis, and contribute to an improved pattern of international transactions, In furtherance of these objectives the Committee agreed at its meeting in February to establish ranges for monetary growth of 4 to 7 percent for Ml, 6 to 9 percent for M2, and 6 to 9-1/2 percent for M3 for the period from the fourth quarter of 1984 to the fourth quarter of 1985, The associated range for total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 9 to 12 percent for the year 1985.  The Committee agreed that growth in the monetary aggregates in the upper part of their ranges for 1985 may  be appropriate, depending on developments with respect to velocity and provided that inflationary pressures remain subdued.",,
19850326,"3/26/85 -14 The Committee understood that policy implementation would require continuing appraisal of the relationships not only among the various measures of money and credit put also between those aggregates and nominal GNP, including evaluation of conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, taking account of the progress against inflation, uncertainties in the business outlook, and the exchange value of the dollar, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. This action is expected to be consistent with growth in Ml, M2, and M3 at annual rates of around 6, 7, and 8 percent respectively during the period from March to June, Somewhat lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth of the monetary aggregates while somewhat greater restraint might be acceptable in the event of substantially higher growth. In either case such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of the business expansion, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic credit and foreign exchange markets. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that pursuit of the monetary objectives and related reserve paths during the period before the next meeting is likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, May 21, 1985.  The meeting adjourned.  Secretary  Secretary's note: On April 16, 1985, by unanimous vote, with Mr. Timlen voting as alternate for  Mr. Corrigan and Messrs. Partee, Rice and Wallich absent and not voting, Committee members approved a temporary increase from $6 billion to $9 billion in the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities for the period ending May 21, 1985.",,
