In this pattern the vector database is only used to locate the most relevant IDs, then those are looked up from a different database.

    "### Data preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to prepare your data. There are a few decisions to keep in mind here:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chunking your data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, \"chunking\" means cutting up the text into reasonable sizes so that the content will fit into the context length of the language model you choose. If your data is small enough or your LLM has a large enough context limit then you can proceed with no chunking, but in many cases you'll need to chunk your data. I'll share two main design patterns here:\n",
    "- **Token-based:** Chunking your data based on some common token threshold i.e. 300, 500, 1000 depending on your use case. This approach works best with a grid-search evaluation to decide the optimal chunking logic over a set of evaluation questions. Variables to consider are whether chunks have overlaps, and whether you extend or truncate a section to keep full sentences and paragraphs together.\n",
    "- **Deterministic:** Deterministic chunking uses some common delimiter, like a page break, paragraph end, section header etc. to chunk. This can work well if you have data of reasonable uniform structure, or if you can use GPT to help annotate the data first so you can guarantee common delimiters. However, it can be difficult to handle your chunks when you stuff them into the prompt given you need to cater for many different lengths of content, so consider that in your application design.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which vectors should you store\n",
    "\n",
    "It is critical to think through the user experience you're building towards because this will inform both the number and content of your vectors. Here are two example use cases that show how these can pan out:\n",
    "- **Tool Manual Knowledge Base:** We have a database of manuals that our customers want to search over. For this use case, we want a vector to allow the user to identify the right manual, before searching a different set of vectors to interrogate the content of the manual to avoid any cross-pollination of similar content between different manuals. \n",
    "    - **Title Vector:** Could include title, author name, brand and abstract.\n",
    "    - **Content Vector:** Includes content only.\n",
    "- **Investor Reports:** We have a database of investor reports that contain financial information about public companies. I want relevant snippets pulled out and summarised so I can decide how to invest. In this instance we want one set of content vectors, so that the retrieval can pull multiple entries on a company or industry, and summarise them to form a composite analysis.\n",
    "    - **Content Vector:** Includes content only, or content supplemented by other features that improve search quality such as author, industry etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For this walkthrough we'll go with 1000 token-based chunking of text content with no overlap, and embed them with the article title included as a prefix."

In other words, light is carried over space by photons. Photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle. In quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy that depends on frequency: A photon associated with light at a higher frequency will have more energy (and be associated with light at a shorter wavelength).\\n\\nPhotons have a rest mass of 0 (zero). However, Einstein\\'s theory of relativity says that they do have a certain amount of momentum. Before the photon got its name, Einstein revived the proposal that light is separate pieces of energy (particles). These particles came to be known as photons. \\n\\nA photon is usually given the symbol γ (gamma),\\n\\nProperties \\n\\nPhotons are fundamental particles. Although they can be created and destroyed, their lifetime is infinite.\\n\\nIn a vacuum, all photons move at the speed of light, c, which is equal to 299,792,458 meters (approximately 300,000 kilometers) per second.\\n\\nA photon has a given frequency, which determines its color.

In other words, light is carried over space by photons. Photon is an elementary particle that is its own antiparticle. In quantum mechanics each photon has a characteristic quantum of energy that depends on frequency: A photon associated with light at a higher frequency will have more energy (and be associated with light at a shorter wavelength).\\n\\nPhotons have a rest mass of 0 (zero). However, Einstein\\'s theory of relativity says that they do have a certain amount of momentum. Before the photon got its name, Einstein revived the proposal that light is separate pieces of energy (particles). These particles came to be known as photons. \\n\\nA photon is usually given the symbol γ (gamma),\\n\\nProperties \\n\\nPhotons are fundamental particles. Although they can be created and destroyed, their lifetime is infinite.\\n\\nIn a vacuum, all photons move at the speed of light, c, which is equal to 299,792,458 meters (approximately 300,000 kilometers) per second.\\n\\nA photon has a given frequency, which determines its color.

    "### Search\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now use our knowledge base to bring back search results. This is one of the areas of highest friction in enterprise knowledge retrieval use cases, with the most common being that the system is not retrieving what you intuitively think are the most relevant documents. There are a few ways of tackling this - I'll share a few options here, as well as some resources to take your research further:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vector search, keyword search or a hybrid\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the strong capabilities out of the box that vector search gives, search is still not a solved problem, and there are well proven [Lucene-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Lucene) search solutions such Elasticsearch and Solr that use methods that work well for certain use cases, as well as the sparse vector methods of traditional NLP such as [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf). If your retrieval is poor, the answer may be one of these in particular, or a combination:\n",
    "- **Vector search:** Converts your text into vector embeddings which can be searched using KNN, SVM or some other model to return the most relevant results. This is the approach we take in this workbook, using a RediSearch vector DB which employs a KNN search under the hood.\n",
    "- **Keyword search:** This method uses any keyword-based search approach to return a score - it could use Elasticsearch/Solr out-of-the-box, or a TF-IDF approach like BM25.\n",
    "- **Hybrid search:** This last approach is a mix of the two, where you produce both a vector search and keyword search result, before using an ```alpha``` between 0 and 1 to weight the outputs. There is a great example of this explained by the Weaviate team [here](https://weaviate.io/blog/hybrid-search-explained).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a novel approach from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496), which states that a hypothetical answer to a question is more semantically similar to the real answer than the question is. In practice this means that your search would use GPT to generate a hypothetical answer, then embed that and use it for search. I've seen success with this both as a pure search, and as a retry step if the initial retrieval fails to retrieve relevant content. A simple example implementation is here:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def answer_question_hyde(question,prompt):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    hyde_prompt = '''You are OracleGPT, an helpful expert who answers user questions to the best of their ability.\n",
    "    Provide a confident answer to their question. If you don't know the answer, make the best guess you can based on the context of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "    User question: USER_QUESTION_HERE\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Answer:'''\n",

    "    \n",
    "    search_results = get_redis_results(redis_client,hypothetical_answer)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return search_results\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fine-tuning embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "This next approach leverages the learning you gain from real question/answer pairs that your users will generate during the evaluation approach. It works by:\n",
    "- Creating a dataset of positive (and optionally negative) question and answer pairs. Positive examples would be a correct retrieval to a question, while negative would be poor retrievals.\n",
    "- Calculating the embeddings for both questions and answers and the cosine similarity between them.\n",
    "- Train a model to optimize the embeddings matrix and test retrieval, picking the best one.\n",
    "- Perform a matrix multiplication of the base Ada embeddings by this new best matrix, creating a new fine-tuned embedding to do for retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a great walkthrough of both the approach and the code to perform it in [this cookbook](./Customizing_embeddings.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reranking\n",
    "\n",
    "One other well-proven method from traditional search solutions that can be applied to any of the above approaches is reranking, where we over-fetch our search results, and then deterministically rerank based on a modifier or set of modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is investor reports again - it is highly likely that if we have 3 reports on Apple, we'll want to make our investment decisions based on the latest one. In this instance a ```recency``` modifier could be applied to the vector scores to sort them, giving us the latest one on the top even if it is not the most semantically similar to our search question.

    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now created a knowledge base that can answer user questions on Wikipedia. However, the user experience could be better, and this is where the Answer layer comes in, where an LLM Agent is used to interact with the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different level of complexity in building a knowledge retrieval experience leveraging an LLM; there is an experience vs. effort trade-off to consider when selecting the right type of interaction. There are many patterns, but I'll highlight a few of the most common here:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choosing the user experience and architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different level of complexity in building a knowledge retrieval experience leveraging an LLM; there is an experience vs. effort trade-off to consider when selecting the right type of interaction. There are many patterns, but I'll highlight a few of the most common here:\n",
    "- **Q&A:** Your classic search engine use case, where the user inputs a question and your LLM gives them an answer either using its knowledge or, much more commonly, using a knowledge base that you prepare using the steps we've covered already. This simple use case assumes no memory of past queries is required, and no ability to clarify with the human or ask for more information.\n",
    "- **Chat:** I think of Chat as being Q&A + memory - this is a slightly more sophisticated interaction where the LLM remembers what was previously asked and can delve deeper on something already covered.\n",
    "- **Agent:** The most sophisticated is what LangChain calls an Agent, they leverage large language models to process and produce human-like results through a variety of tools, and will chain queries together dynamically until it has an answer that the LLM feels is appropriate to answer the user's question. However, for every \"turn\" you allow between Agent and user you increase the risks of loss of context, hallucination, or parsing errors, so be clear about the exact requirements your users have before embarking on building the Answer layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q&A use cases are the simplest to implement, while Agents can give the most sophisticated user experience - in this notebook we'll build an Agent with memory and a single Tool to give an appreciation for the flexibilty prompt chaining gives you in getting a more complete answer for your users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensuring reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "The more complexity you add, the more chance your LLM will fail to respond correctly, or a response will come back in the wrong format and break your Answer pipeline. We'll share a few methods our customers have used elsewhere to help \"channel\" the Agent down a more deterministic path, and to deal with issues when they do crop up:\n",
    "- **Prompt chaining:** Prompting the model to take a step-by-step approach and think aloud using a scratchpad has been proven to deliver more consistent results. It also means that as a developer you can break up one complex prompt into many simpler, more deterministic prompts, with the output of one prompt becoming the input for the next. This approach is known as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning - I'd suggest digging deeper as this is a dynamic new area of research, with a few of the key papers referenced here:\n",
    "    - Chain of thought prompting [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)\n",
    "    - Self-reflecting agent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366)\n",
    "- **Self-referencing:** You can return references for the LLM's answer through either your application logic, or by prompt engineering it to return references. I would generally suggest doing it in your application logic, although if you have multiple chunks then a hybrid approach where you ask the LLM to return the key of the chunk it used could be advisable. I view this as a UX opportunity, where for many search use cases giving the \"raw\" output of the chunks retrieved as well as the summarised answer can give the user the best of both worlds, but please go with whatever is most appropriate for your users.\n",
    "- **Discriminator models:** The best control for unwanted outputs is undoubtably through preventing it from happening with prompt engineering, prompt chaining and retrieval. However, when all these fail then a discriminator model is a useful detective control. This is a classifier trained on past unwanted outputs, that flags the Agent's response to the user as Safe or Not, enabling you to perform some business logic to either retry, pass to a human, or say it doesn't know. \n",
    "    - There is an example in our [Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5528730-fine-tuning-a-classifier-to-improve-truthfulness).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a dynamic topic that has still not consolidated to a clear design that works best above all others, so for ease of implementation we will use LangChain, which supplies a framework with implementations for most of the concepts we've discussed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create an Agent with access to our knowledge base, give it a prompt template and a custom parser for extracting the answers, set up a prompt chain and then let it answer our Wikipedia questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our work here draws heavily on LangChain's great documentation, in particular [this guide](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agents/custom_llm_chat_agent.html)."

    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Last comes the not-so-fun bit that will make the difference between nifty prototype and production application - the process of evaluating and tuning your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway here is to make a framework that saves the results of each evaluation, as well as the parameters. Evaluation can be a difficult task that takes significant resources, so it is best to start prepared to handle multiple iterations. Some useful principles we've seen successful deployments use are:\n",
    "- **Assign clear product ownership and metrics:** Ensure you have a team aligned from the start to annotate the outputs and determine whether they're bad or good. This may seem an obvious step, but too often the focus is on the engineering challenge of successfully retrieving content rather than the product challenge of providing retrieval results that are useful.\n",
    "- **Log everything:** Store all requests and responses to and from your LLM and retrieval service if you can, it builds a great base for fine-tuning both the embeddings and any fine-tuned models or few-shot LLMs in future.\n",
    "- **Use GPT-4 as a labeller:** When running evaluations, it can help to use GPT-4 as a gatekeeper for human annotation. Human annotation is costly and time-consuming, so doing an initial evaluation run with GPT-4 can help set a quality bar that needs to be met to justify human labeling. At this stage I would not suggest using GPT-4 as your only labeler, but it can certainly ease the burden.\n",
    "    - This approach is outlined further in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13487).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use these principles to make a quick evaluation framework where we will:\n",
    "- Use GPT-4 to make a list of hypothetical questions on our topic\n",
    "- Ask our Agent the questions and save question/answer tuples\n",
    "    - These two above steps simulate the actual users interacting with your application\n",
    "- Get GPT-4 to evaluate whether the answers correctly respond to the questions\n",
    "- Look at our results to measure how well the Agent answered the questions\n",
    "- Plan remedial action"
