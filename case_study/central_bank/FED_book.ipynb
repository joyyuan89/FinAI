It charac-\\nterizes regional economic conditions and prospects based on a variety \\nof mostly qualitative information, gathered directly from each District ’s \\nsources. Reports are published eight times per year.  \\nWhat is the purpose of the Beige Book?  \\nThe Beige Book is intended to characterize the change in economic \\nconditions since the last report. Outreach for the Beige Book is one of \\nmany ways the Federal Reserve System engages with businesses and \\nother organizations about economic developments in their communi-\\nties. Because this information is collected from a wide range of con-\\ntacts through a variety of formal and informal methods, the Beige Book \\ncan complement other forms of regional information gathering. The \\nBeige Book is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve \\nofficials.  \\nHow is the information collected?  \\nEach Federal Reserve Bank gathers information on current economic \\nconditions in its District through reports from Bank and Branch direc-\\ntors, plus interviews and online questionnaires completed by business-\\nes, community organizations, economists, market experts, and other \\nsources. Contacts are not selected at random; rather, Banks strive to \\ncurate a diverse set of sources that can provide accurate and objective \\ninformation about a broad range of economic activities. The Beige \\nBook serves as a regular summary of this information for the public.  \\nHow is the information used?  \\nThe information from contacts supplements the data and analysis used \\nby Federal Reserve economists and staff to assess economic condi-\\ntions in the Federal Reserve Districts. The qualitative nature of the \\nBeige Book creates an opportunity to characterize dynamics and identi-\\nfy emerging trends in the economy that may not be readily apparent in \\nthe available economic data. This information enables comparison of \\neconomic conditions in different parts of the country, which can be \\nhelpful for assessing the outlook for the national economy.  \\nThe Beige Book does not have the type of information I’m looking \\nfor. What other information is available?  \\nThe Federal Reserve System conducts a wide array of recurring sur-\\nveys of businesses, households, and community organizations. A list of \\nstatistical releases compiled by the Federal Reserve Board is available \\nhere, links to each of the Federal Reserve Banks are available here, \\nand a summary of the System ’s community outreach is available here. \\nIn addition, Fed Listens  events have been held around the country to \\nhear about how monetary policy affects peoples ’ daily lives and liveli-\\nhoods.  The System also relies on a variety of advisory councils —\\nwhose members are drawn from a wide array of businesses, non -profit \\norganizations, and community groups —to hear diverse perspectives on \\nthe economy in carrying out its responsibilities.

Five Districts reported slight or modest growth, five noted \\nno change, and two reported slight and modest declines. Reports on consumer spending were mixed; growth was \\ngenerally observed in consumer services, but some retailers noted shifts away from discretionary spending. Tourism \\nand travel activity was robust, and hospitality contacts expected a busy summer season. Auto sales remained un-\\nchanged or exhibited moderate growth across most Districts. Manufacturing activity edged up in half of the Districts and \\ndeclined in the other half. Transportation activity was down or flat in most Districts that reported on it, as some contacts \\nreported reduced demand due to high inventory levels and others noted continued challenges from labor shortages. \\nBanking conditions were mostly subdued, as lending activity continued to soften. Despite higher mortgage rates, de-\\nmand for residential real estate remained steady, although sales were constrained by low inventories. Construction for \\nboth residential and commercial units was slightly lower on balance. Agricultural conditions were mixed geographically \\nbut softened slightly on balance, with some contacts expecting further softening for the remainder of 2023. Energy \\nactivity decreased. Overall economic expectations for the coming months generally continued to call for slow growth . \\nLabor Markets  \\nEmployment increased modestly this period, with most Districts experiencing some job growth. Labor demand re-\\nmained healthy, though some contacts reported that hiring was getting more targeted and selective. Employers contin-\\nued to have difficulty finding workers, particularly in health care, transportation, and hospitality, and for high -skilled \\npositions in general. However, many Districts reported that labor availability had improved and that some employers \\nwere having an easier time hiring than they were having previously. Employers also reported that the unusually high \\nturnover rates in recent years appear to be returning to pre -pandemic norms. Wages continued to rise, but more mod-\\nerately. Contacts in multiple Districts reported that wage increases were returning to or nearing pre -pandemic levels . \\nPrices  \\nPrices increased at a modest pace overall, and several Districts noted some slowing in the pace of increase. Consumer \\nprices generally increased, though reports differed in the extent to which firms were able to pass along input cost in-\\ncreases. Contacts in some Districts noted reluctance to raise prices because consumers had grown more sensitive to \\nprices, while others reported that solid demand allowed firms to maintain margins. Input cost pressures remained ele-\\nvated for services firms but eased notably in the manufacturing sector. Freight rates continued to decrease, along with \\nthe prices for many construction inputs, though concrete prices increased. Price expectations were generally stable or \\nlower over the next several months .  \\nBoston  \\nBusiness activity expanded at a slight pace. Employment \\ngains were small and prices were stable. Consumer \\nspending increased by a small margin. Manufacturers \\nreported moderate revenue growth. Home sales were \\ndisappointing and life sciences leasing activity slowed \\ndramatically. The outlook was optimistic outside of real \\nestate, but remained neutral or became increasingly \\npessimistic among real estate contacts.  New York  \\nRegional economic activity stabilized after a period of \\nweakness. Labor market conditions were strong, with \\nsome firming in recent weeks. Inflationary pressures \\neased noticeably. Consumer spending grew steadily. \\nHousing markets were solid but low inventory continued \\nto restrain sales activity .

Consumer demand ticked \\ndown, although elevated profit margins buoyed overall \\nsales figures. Employment fell slightly despite improved \\nlabor availability. Wage growth and inflation subsided but \\ncontinued at a modest pace. Expectations for economic \\ngrowth remained subdued.   \\nCleveland  \\nThe Fourth District economy was generally stable in \\nrecent weeks as high interest rates continued to con-\\nstrain households ’ big-ticket goods purchases and busi-\\nnesses ’ project plans. Bankers and transportation firms \\ncited these effects as contributing to weaker demand for \\ntheir own services. Nevertheless, contacts were general-\\nly more optimistic about the near -term outlook and less \\nconcerned that a U.S. recession would occur in 2023 . \\nRichmond  \\nThe regional economy grew slightly in recent weeks. \\nConsumer spending on retail goods, as well as on travel \\nand tourism, picked up modestly. Manufacturing and \\ntransportation sectors noted a slowdown in demand. \\nResidential real estate was constrained by a lack of \\ninventory. Commercial real estate activity and lending \\ndeclined. Employment increased moderately and price \\ngrowth eased slightly but remained robust, overall .  \\nAtlanta  \\nEconomic activity grew slowly. Labor markets became \\nless tight, and wage pressures eased. Nonlabor costs \\nmoderated, on balance. Discretionary retail sales sof-\\ntened. Auto sales remained strong. Domestic leisure \\ntravel softened, and international and business travel \\nrose. Housing demand remained strong. Transportation \\nactivity slowed. Energy demand was steady. Agriculture \\nconditions softened .  \\nChicago  \\nEconomic activity was little changed. Employment in-\\ncreased moderately; nonbusiness contacts saw little \\nchange in activity; consumer spending was flat; business \\nspending and construction and real estate activity de-\\nclined slightly; and manufacturing decreased modestly. \\nPrices and wages rose moderately, while financial condi-\\ntions tightened slightly further. Expectations for farm \\nincomes in 2023 decreased some . St. Louis  \\nEconomic conditions have remained unchanged since \\nour previous report. Employers continued to struggle \\nfinding skilled workers, but turnover slowed and wage \\npressures lessened. Consumer spending was largely \\nsteady, but contacts reported a shift away from discre-\\ntionary goods. Homebuying activity increased, but the \\ncommercial real estate sector saw worsening conditions . \\nMinneapolis  \\nEconomic activity in the region grew slightly in recent \\nweeks. Employment rose moderately as labor availability \\nimproved. Price pressures were mild and wages rose \\nmoderately. Consumer spending was flat. Professional \\nservices reported solid activity and a positive outlook. \\nResidential construction and real estate remained low. \\nDry conditions have lowered the farm outlook. Minority - \\nand women -owned firms reported steady activity . \\nKansas City  \\nTotal economic activity across the Tenth District \\nchanged little during June. Though hiring was flat, ex-\\npected employment levels at most businesses continued \\nto point downward.

Concerns \\nabout credit quality and credit access rose broadly, \\nincluding among micro -businesses, consumers, and \\ncommercial real estate . \\nDallas  \\nModest expansion continued buoyed by gains in the \\nservice sector and single -family housing. Factory output, \\ndrilling activity and loan demand declined, and credit \\nconditions tightened further. Employment rose moderate-\\nly, and wage growth remained high.

Consumer spending increased by a small margin, as retail sales increased modestly and tourism was flat. Manu-\\nfacturers reported mixed results but sales growth was moderate on average. Software and IT services firms enjoyed \\nstable demand and modest revenue gains. Residential home sales increased slightly in May from the previous month  \\nbut remained below seasonal norms. Commercial real estate markets weakened further, with abrupt declines in life  \\nsciences leasing and financial distress showing up for office properties. The outlook was mostly optimistic among con-\\ntacts outside of real estate. Residential real estate contacts expected sales to remain muted and commercial real estate \\ncontacts braced for declines in activity and property values moving forward . \\nLabor Markets  \\nEmployment increased modestly and wage growth con-\\ntinued to moderate as labor market imbalances eased \\nfurther. Among retail and tourism contacts, labor demand \\nremained healthy but showed signs of moderating, and \\nthere were modest improvements in the available labor \\nsupply. Some airline contacts continued to struggle to fill \\npositions but said that hiring and training were underway \\nto improve the situation. A clothing retailer noted that it \\nhad taken several months to fill 200 warehouse jobs, but \\nthey were nonetheless able to fill all positions. Following \\ntwo summers of worker shortages on Cape Cod, some \\nrestaurant and hotel owners there have achieved effi-\\nciencies enabling them to operate with a smaller staff. In \\nmanufacturing, the labor market remained tight, although \\ncontacts said that it had improved over last year, and \\nheadcounts increased modestly. Headcounts at software \\nand IT firms were up slightly, and hiring plans were \\nmixed. Contacts noted that turnover had either stabilized \\n(albeit at above -average rates) or decreased in recent \\nmonths, and reductions in turnover and absenteeism \\nreduced the need for hiring at some firms. Wage pres-\\nsures were described as stable or, in most cases, declin-\\ning, as wage growth rates continued to fall back to more \\nmoderate levels.  \\nPrices \\nPrices were mostly stable, with some exceptions, as cost \\npressures abated further. A clothing retailer said that \\ninput cost growth had ceased altogether and that their output prices were flat. Manufacturing c ontacts reported \\na very benign pricing environment, with one even men-\\ntioning the possibility of deflation. Prices were slightly \\nhigher among IT contacts, but with no further price in-\\ncreases anticipated. Hotel room rates in Greater Boston \\nincreased in excess of seasonal patterns, rising 12 per-\\ncent on a year -over-year basis. Cape Cod rental prices \\nincreased yet again, but at a much more modest pace \\nthan in recent years. The outlook called for further mod-\\neration of pricing pressures moving forward . \\nRetail and Tourism  \\nFirst District retail contacts reported a modest uptick in \\nsales relative to earlier this year, while tourism contacts \\nsaw mixed results that were about flat on average. A \\nclothing retailer enjoyed a slight uptick in demand this \\nspring after a soft first quarter. Mainstreet retailers on \\nCape Cod experienced a strong start to the high season, \\nbut hospitality contacts on the Cape said that occupancy \\nrates for hotels and especially short -term rentals were \\ndown by modest to large margins from their record highs \\nof the past two years, though still above 2019 levels. \\nAirline passenger traffic through Boston further in-\\ncreased in recent months, reaching 96 percent of pre -\\npandemic levels in the first quarter of 2023, and interna-\\ntional passenger traffic alone reached 99 percent of pre -\\npandemic levels, although travel to and from Asian mar-\\nkets remained depressed.

A pharmaceuti-\\ncal company reported lower sales that were nonetheless \\nin line with their expectations, owing to increased com-\\npetition from generics. A frozen fish producer said that \\nsales were down year -on-year due to higher prices. \\nOther contacts reported very strong sales. A furniture \\nproducer recorded its best second -quarter results ever, \\nup markedly from a weak first quarter. A semiconductor \\nmanufacturer said that, despite an industrywide slump, \\ntheir own sales were up 12 percent from a year earlier, \\nan outcome attributed to the firm ’s heavy exposure to the \\nautomotive industry and the transition to electric cars. \\nOne contact said they had revised their capital expendi-\\nture plans to take advantage of tax credits, although this \\nmostly involved moving existing projects forward rather \\nthan adding investments. The outlook was positive \\nacross the board. The semiconductor manufacturer in \\nparticular expected that 2024 would bring demand in-\\ncreases linked to upgrades of phones and PCs as well \\nas from the diffusion of AI products .  \\nIT and Software Services  \\nContacts in IT and software services posted modest \\nrevenue gains on average, and demand was steady over \\nthe first two quarters of 2023. Profits and margins were \\nup slightly, although Q2 expenses increased above \\nexpectations at one firm. Capital and technology spend-\\ning was unchanged or down somewhat. One firm ex-\\npected to slow its capital spending further moving for-\\nward amidst an ongoing transition to the cloud. Outlooks \\nwere generally optimistic, with expectations of ongoing \\nstability in demand. One contact expressed confidence \\nthat their business would hold up well moving forward \\neven if the broader economy turned down. However, one \\ncontact was concerned the presidential election might \\ndisrupt the stability of the business environment .  \\nCommercial Real Estate  \\nCommercial real estate activity in the First District was \\nmoderately weaker in recent months. Office leasing was \\nstable or down slightly, with very few leases signed. \\nOffice rents were roughly stable and vacancy rates were \\nsaid to be either flat or rising slowly. A contact in Con-\\nnecticut reported a high -quality urban office building \\nbeing forced into foreclosure due to tenants giving back \\nspace upon lease expiration. Life sciences leasing activi-\\nty slowed dramatically, a fact attributed to the drying up of venture capital and other funding sources to would -be \\ntenants. Contacts reported a somewhat quieter industrial \\nmarket than in the past two years, although industrial \\nrents remained high and vacancy rates historically low. \\nGrocery -anchored retail continued to perform well, but \\nother retail vacancies ticked up due to the failure of \\nsome non -grocery chains. Across sectors, contacts ’ \\nexpectations turned more pessimistic. High borrowing \\ncosts are expected to continue to deter investment, \\nsales, and construction. Multiple contacts expected the \\nmarket to fare better in New England than in other re-\\ngions of the country, but nonetheless expected activity in \\nthe region to slow and property valuations to fall accord-\\ningly. \\nResidential Real Estate  \\nFirst District home sales increased a bit in May from the \\nprevious month on average, and some areas reported a \\nhealthy uptick in activity, but May ’s sales were nonethe-\\nless described as weak relative to historical norms. \\nAcross markets, home sales continued to post very \\nsteep declines on a year -over-year basis, for single -\\nfamily dwelling as well as condos. According to contacts, \\nactivity was held back yet again by further declines in \\ninventory (on a year -over-year basis) and persistently \\nhigh mortgage interest rates. High rates also exacerbat-\\ned the low -inventory problem, as current homeowners \\nwere reluctant to swap their existing, low -rate mortgages \\nfor higher -rate loans, leading to fewer homes going up \\nfor sale. Despite tepid sales, the dearth of inventories \\nrelative to demand meant that prices continued to rise, \\neven as the pace of appreciation slowed gradually in \\nrecent months. Median prices for single -family homes \\nrose modestly relative to May 2022, by six percent or \\nless depending on the area. However, median condo \\nprices increased by double -digit margins in some states, \\nas buyers priced out of the single -family market looked \\nincreasingly to condos. Contacts expected no meaning-\\nful changes in market dynamics until interest rates de-\\nclined .■ \\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: \\nwww.bostonfed.org/regional -economy  ', metadata={'date': '20230712', 'category': 'FED Beige Book', 'author': 'FED'}),\n",

Regional banks reported ongoing declines in loan demand, \\ntighter credit conditions, and narrowing loan spreads. Looking ahead, businesses expect economic conditions to im-\\nprove, though optimism remained muted.  \\nLabor Markets \\nLabor market conditions were strong, with several con-\\ntacts pointing to some firming in recent weeks. On bal-\\nance, employment increased modestly, though there \\nwere stronger gains reported by personal service provid-\\ners and wholesalers. While firms in the construction \\nsector reportedly shed workers, layoffs generally re-\\nmained concentrated in large firms outside of the region. \\nA contact from the Adirondacks reported that J -1 visa \\nseasonal workers have arrived following a pandemic \\npause, providing a much -needed seasonal boost to the \\nstrained workforce as the tourism season gets into full \\nswing. Though it has become slightly easier to hire, find-\\ning skilled workers remains a major challenge.  \\nWhile hiring plans remained solid, a few employers point-\\ned to scattered signs of easing in labor demand. Con-\\ntacts reported that the use of temporary workers has \\ndeclined noticeably. Further, attrition rates have contin-\\nued to fall at many businesses and are in some cases \\nbelow normal levels, reducing the need to hire replace-\\nments. With signs that the labor market may start to cool, \\nsome employers are beginning to require workers to \\ncome to the office more often. Indeed, a New York City \\nemployment agency focused on financial services noted \\nthat roughly half of open roles were now fully in -person.  \\nWage growth has remained modest and steady since the \\nlast report. Several contacts noted that candidates ’ wage \\ndemands have become more reasonable and are now in -\\nline with pre -pandemic expectations.  Prices  \\nInflationary pressures eased noticeably in recent weeks. \\nBusinesses reported that the pace of input price increas-\\nes has slowed considerably, and one construction con-\\ntact noted softening in the prices of inputs, such as doors \\nand windows. Still, the high cost of many inputs remains \\na major challenge for businesses in the region. The pace \\nof selling price increases also moderated, especially \\namong goods producers and retailers, though business-\\nes in leisure & hospitality noted growing price pressures \\nin travel services and entertainment. Manufacturers \\ngenerally expect continued easing in price increases in \\nthe months ahead, while firms in the broader service \\nsector anticipated more persistence.   \\nConsumer Spending  \\nConsumer spending grew steadily in the latest reporting \\nperiod. Consumers have continued to shift their spend-\\ning away from goods toward experiences, such as travel, \\nentertainment, and restaurants. Indeed, amid higher \\nprices and changing preferences, department store \\ncontacts reported sagging sales. Increasingly discerning \\nshoppers eschewed purchases of seasonal items in \\nfavor of high -quality basics during a cool spring season, \\nleaving an inventory surplus of certain summer wear. \\nStill, auto dealers in upstate New York reported that new \\ncar sales have been strong as pent -up demand has \\nbeen satisfied by ongoing improvements in inventory, \\nwhile used car sales remained subdued.

Looking ahead, businesses in the service sector \\nanticipated some improvement in the coming months.  \\nTourism activity remained strong in New York City and is \\non track to reach pre -pandemic levels this summer. The \\nrecent air quality problems from wildfire smoke had only \\nminor effects on tourism, with the biggest blows to out-\\ndoor attractions. The recovery of business travel has \\nbeen slower, hindered by a shift to virtual events and a \\nbudget -driven reduction in attendance at in -person meet-\\nings.     \\nReal Estate and Construction  \\nWhile the home sales market has remained solid, there \\nhas been some cooling in parts of the District. In particu-\\nlar, demand softened in much of upstate New York as \\ndiscouraged buyers frustrated by low inventory increas-\\ningly stepped aside. Meanwhile, home sales markets in \\nand around New York City remained resilient as potential \\nbuyers were undeterred by low inventory. Home prices \\nwere steady to up slightly; bidding wars were common \\nacross the District, though at reduced intensity.  \\nResidential rental markets have continued to firm, as a \\nstrong economy and relatively high mortgage rates have \\ncontinued to boost demand by pushing some potential \\nhomeowners into the rental market. In New York City, \\nvacancy rates were below historic norms and rents \\nreached new highs, and rents also edged up in much of \\nupstate New York.  \\nCommercial real estate markets were mostly unchanged. \\nOffice vacancy rates held steady at elevated levels \\nacross the District and rents were mostly flat, though \\nsome businesses reduced their footprints and opted for \\nhigher -quality office space. Of note, the prolonged weak-\\nness in office markets has begun to spillover to architec-\\nture and engineering firms, who noted negative impacts on business activity. New York City ’s retail market was flat, \\nwith no change in vacancy rates, rents, or leasing activity \\nin recent weeks. By contrast, vacancy rates remained at \\nlow levels in the industrial market and rents trended up \\nmodestly, except in northern New Jersey, where vacancy \\nrates increased somewhat.  \\nOverall, construction contacts reported that conditions \\ncontinued to weaken since the last report. Office construc-\\ntion remained steady at a low level in most of the District, \\nthough there were some new starts in northern New Jer-\\nsey and upstate New York. Industrial construction activity \\nwas little changed across most of the District. Multi -family \\nresidential starts increased in Long Island and Westches-\\nter but were flat elsewhere.    \\nBanking and Finance  \\nConditions in the broad finance sector continued to deteri-\\norate, though at a more subdued pace than in recent \\nmonths. Small to medium -sized banks in the District re-\\nported ongoing declines in loan demand across all loan \\nsegments. Credit standards continued to tighten for all loan \\ntypes, loan spreads narrowed, and deposit rates moved \\nhigher. Delinquency rates edged up. Contacts cautioned \\nthat the average loan -to-value ratio on outstanding used \\ncar loans has risen to about 120 percent, presenting po-\\ntential risks to the auto finance market.  \\nCommunity Perspectives  \\nContacts noted that shortfalls in community services are \\nworsening food insecurity, homelessness, and public \\nsafety. Community leaders expressed concerns about the \\ninadequacy of the region ’s mental health care system. \\nContacts expressed the need for supportive housing units \\nthat are integrated with social services and medical sup-\\nport for addiction treatment and mental health care. Non -\\nprofits reported working with hospitals that own large real \\nestate portfolios to develop sites for middle -income and \\nsupportive housing, though elevated construction costs \\nand strained supply chains have hindered progress on this \\nfront. ■ \\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit:  \\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/regional -economy  ', metadata={'date': '20230712', 'category': 'FED Beige Book', 'author': 'FED'}),\n",

While consumer spending on \\nservices remained solid, higher interest rates continued to constrain households ’ big-ticket purchases. Meanwhile, sev-\\neral contacts suggested that higher interest rates led many businesses to delay projects. Accordingly, bankers reported \\nlower loan volumes for both household and business loans. Manufacturers reported little growth in orders, but many \\ncontinued to work through solid backlogs. Contacts have recently become more optimistic about the near -term outlook \\nfor their firms, and many have lowered their expectations for a US recession in 2023. Still, uncertainty remained elevat-\\ned and was likely reflected in cautious capital spending plans and slower employment growth. Wage pressures contin-\\nued to ease somewhat as labor demand lessened and labor availability improved for many firms. Input cost pressures \\nalso eased, and the share of firms reporting increased selling prices dipped to its lowest level since late 2020.  \\nLabor Markets  \\nContact reports suggested modest employment growth \\nin the Fourth District during the most recent reporting \\nperiod, with demand for labor varying by industry seg-\\nment. Demand was particularly strong among manufac-\\nturers that continued to report solid backlogs for their \\ngoods. Still, a few manufacturers (and contacts in other \\nindustries) reported that they were only hiring to fill key \\nproduction positions while leaving others unfilled (such \\nas those in support). The hesitance to fill support roles \\nwas mainly a function of general economic uncertainty \\nor expectations for weaker demand for goods and ser-\\nvices.  \\nOn balance, wage pressures eased slightly during this \\nreporting period, with the share of contacts holding \\nwages steady (67 percent) at its highest in more than \\ntwo years. Some bankers, transportation firms, and \\nrestauranteurs reported that they did not need to in-\\ncrease wages because workers were more readily avail-\\nable. By contrast, several manufacturing and construc-\\ntion firms reported that wage pressures remained high \\namid continued difficulty filling key openings.    \\nPrices \\nNonlabor input costs pressures eased since the previ-\\nous report. About a third of contacts said that costs had \\nincreased in the prior two months, the smallest share \\nsince September 2020. Construction contacts noted that \\nsteel and lumber prices were falling but concrete prices were rising. On balance, these contacts suggested that \\ncosts were “stabilizing. ” Manufacturers reported mean-\\ningful relief from input cost increases, as well, with one \\nplastics manufacturer stating that suppliers were raising \\nprices less often and by a smaller percentage than in the \\npast. Looking forward, contacts expected further relief \\nfrom nonlabor input cost pressures.  \\nPrice pressures eased, as well. Less than 40 percent of \\nfirms recently raised selling prices, the lowest share \\nrecorded since the end of 2020. Several goods produc-\\ners raised prices to maintain margins or to “catch up ” to \\npast cost increases. However, many also said they did \\nso cautiously. One manufacturer said it couldn ’t raise \\nprices “without hurting demand or damaging customer \\nrelationships. ” Similarly, a logistics contact noted that \\ncustomers were increasingly resistant to any price in-\\ncreases and that freight prices fell further.

Contacts \\ngenerally expected consumer demand to hold steady in \\nthe coming months.  \\nManufacturing  \\nOn balance, demand for manufactured goods was sta-\\nble. Orders remained strong for aerospace -related prod-\\nucts and for heavy trucks and trailers, and strengthening \\ninternational markets continued to bolster activity for \\nsome firms. However, orders softened or remained weak \\nfor some firms tied to consumer products as inventory \\ncorrections continued. Steel manufacturers said that \\norders were steady or slightly lower compared to those \\nin recent months, and industry contacts generally ex-\\npected demand for their products to pick up in the sec-\\nond half of July following an expected seasonal slow-\\ndown earlier in the month. Likewise, manufacturers \\nacross industry segments were notably optimistic and \\nexpected demand for their products to increase in the \\ncoming months.  \\nReal Estate and Construction  \\nDemand for residential construction and real estate \\nchanged little in recent weeks. Contacts reported that \\nhigher interest rates and elevated home prices continued \\nto hinder demand. One homebuilder noted, “we’re get-\\nting sales, but on the slow side. ” Going forward, contacts \\nwere optimistic that demand would improve. One home-\\nbuilder noted that the limited supply of existing homes \\nwould help to boost demand for new home construction.  \\nNonresidential construction and real estate activity re-\\nmained soft. Several general contractors indicated that \\nhigh borrowing costs were dampening demand for con-\\nstruction, and several commercial real estate contacts \\nnoted slowing in the commercial real estate investment \\nmarket.  \\nFinancial Services \\nLenders reported weaker activity amid economic uncer-\\ntainty and higher interest rates. Loan demand de-\\ncreased, with declines noted for both household and \\nbusiness lending. One banker said that many business-\\nes were putting projects on hold because of economic \\nuncertainty unless the project is being subsidized by the \\ngovernment. On the funding side, deposits were general-\\nly flat to down as banks continued to face competition for \\ndeposits, particularly from entities such as money market funds. On balance, delinquency rates remained low by \\nhistorical standards and were little changed in recent \\nweeks, with one lender describing the delinquency rate \\nenvironment as “benign. ” Looking forward, lenders ex-\\npected further declines in loan volumes and little change \\nin deposits.  \\nNonfinancial Services  \\nDemand for nonfinancial business services generally \\ndeclined recently. Contacts in professional and business \\nservices noted that demand had flattened. Transporta-\\ntion services firms reported declines in activity, in large \\npart because firms continued to work down inventories, \\nsome of which had been built up as a hedge against \\nsupply chain disruptions earlier in the recovery. Looking \\nforward, firms in professional and business services \\ngenerally expected demand to rebound in the months \\nahead. By contrast, logistics and freight contacts antici-\\npated further declines, though one freight contact was \\noptimistic that “the bottom is in the not -too-distant fu-\\nture.”  \\nCommunity Conditions  \\nCommunity organizations reported a sharp increase in \\nthe number of families seeking food assistance recently, \\nwith one noting that it had seen a 35 percent jump since \\nMarch. Multiple contacts said that the loss of pandemic -\\nera Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \\nbenefits in March, along with elevated food prices, con-\\ntributed to the increase. One food pantry operator said, \\n“people are experiencing food insecurity more now than I \\nhave seen in my seven years with the organization. ” \\nSome organizations were forced to limit the frequency of \\nvisits and quantity of food provided to households, exac-\\nerbating the strain on struggling families.

Retailers and food service companies saw steady to increasing \\nconsumer spending, particularly for seasonal goods. Auto sales, however, were down slightly and inventory levels re-\\nmained very low. Travel and tourism picked up, but travel shifted more towards larger city and international travel. Nonfi-\\nnancial services firms reported stable demand, but some noted that clients were holding back capital due to economic \\nuncertainties. Manufacturing activity slowed as new orders declined. District ports echoed that sentiment and noted that  \\nimports slowed as retailers and manufacturers still had elevated inventory levels. Loaded exports, particularly agriculture  \\nproducts, remained strong. Trucking firms also reported lower freight volumes this cycle. Residential real estate condi-\\ntions softened as activity was still being restrained by a lack of available inventory. Commercial real estate markets were \\nmixed as retail and industrial segments remained strong but multifamily activity leveled off and office vacancy rates \\nrose. Commercial loan demand softened while consumer loan demand was little changed. Employment picked up mod-\\nerately and wage growth eased slightly but wage pressures remained elevated amid a continued tight labor market. \\nPrice growth continued to ease but remained elevated compared to pre -pandemic inflation rates.   \\nLabor Markets \\nEmployment grew moderately over the most recent \\nreporting period. Businesses continued to face challeng-\\nes finding workers, but those challenges were more \\nisolated to specific industries and skill -levels. A software \\ncompany reported that finding IT workers at reasonable \\nrates has become easier. Conversely, a company that \\noffers tour bus vacations struggled to find drivers and \\nmechanical technicians, which was keeping them from \\noperating at a higher level. Wage growth eased some-\\nwhat but there were some reports that wage pressures \\nremained high. One contact, for example, reported that \\nthey were closely monitoring inflation and trying to adjust \\nwages to ensure they were providing a living wage for \\ntheir staff while remaining competitive in the market.  \\nPrices \\nPrice growth continued to moderate in recent weeks, \\nparticularly for services. According to our most recent \\nsurveys, prices received by manufacturers declined \\nsharply in June, falling below four percent year -over-year \\ngrowth. Services firms also saw price growth moderate \\nslightly in June, but the annual growth rate remained just \\nabove five percent. A few businesses remarked that the \\nincreased cost of capital was driving up their expenses \\nand they were increasing their prices as a result. Howev-\\ner, some added that they were not able to push the full \\ncost through to customers, so margins were tightening.  Manufacturing  \\nFifth District manufacturing firms reported some slow-\\ndown in business activity during the most recent report-\\ning period. Firms reported that rising interest rates and a \\npullback in consumer spending on goods led to declines \\nin new orders. A dental laboratory reported not meeting \\ntheir numbers for the past six months due to a significant \\nslowdown in the dental market. A furniture manufacturer \\nreported that they were having layoffs for only the sec-\\nond time in their forty -two-year history due to declining \\nbusiness conditions. Several contacts reported imbal-\\nances in inventory levels as finished goods inventories \\nwere creeping upwards. This is especially true in the \\nretail manufacturing sector as retailers pulled back on \\nnew orders.  \\nPorts and Transportation  \\nFifth District ports stated that loaded import volume was \\ndown this period, but that volume was close to pre -\\npandemic levels. Many big retailers still have elevated \\ninventory levels causing a decrease in imports of con-\\nsumer goods. However, there was a slight increase in \\nimports of machinery and parts. Loaded export volumes \\nwere strong mainly driven by agricultural products and \\nlower value commodities. Spot prices remained low \\nthough still slightly higher than in 2019.

In the last month, airfreight was soft com-\\npared to recent years but still above 2019 levels and \\nwas driven primarily by imports as exports were down \\ndrastically.  \\nTrucking firms reported that shipping demand remained \\nsoft this period as customers were still dealing with \\nelevated inventories and reduced orders. However, food \\nand pharmaceuticals shipping volumes were holding up \\nwell. Spot shipping rates were at low levels as there was \\na lot of excess capacity in the truck load segment. How-\\never, respondents indicated that they were able to get \\nmoderate increases with their contract rates despite \\ncustomers being very price sensitive. Companies stated \\nthat drivers were more readily available. Trucking firms \\nalso remarked that the higher labor costs, as well as \\ndramatically higher costs of parts and new equipment, \\nwere impacting profitability.  \\nRetail, Travel, and Tourism  \\nRetailers reported steady to modest growth in sales in \\nrecent weeks. Several of the businesses that saw in-\\ncreased sales noted that it was partly due to typical \\nseasonal patterns as they were geared towards summer \\nshopping. Restaurants and novelty food services report-\\ned strong sales and steady demand. Auto sales, on the \\nother hand, declined slightly and dealers commented \\nthat limited inventory and elevated interest rates were \\nimpeding sales volumes.  \\nTravel and tourism increased slightly, on balance, but \\nseveral contacts saw some shifts in consumer behavior. \\nFor example, travel picked up in Baltimore and Wash-\\nington, D.C. while coastal areas of the district reported \\nslightly lower occupancy and revenues in recent months; \\nhowever, the expectation was for beach travel to pick up \\ngoing into the summer months. An airport contact said \\nthat consumer travel was steady and saw more people \\ntaking international flights than in recent years.  \\nReal Estate and Construction  \\nResidential real estate respondents indicated that the \\ninventory of homes for sale remained constrained with \\ncontract prices continuing to appreciate slightly. Overall, \\nthe number of sales decreased primarily due to the low \\nhousing inventory as well as the usual seasonal slow-\\ndown. In the last month, buyer traffic was steady and \\ndays on market continued to be low. Prospective buyers \\nwere not having any difficulties obtaining mortgages but \\nthere were some issues with appraisals not coming in at \\nthe escalated sales price. Residential construction firms \\nnoted a decrease in demand for their services as home-\\nowners were less willing to plan for large remodeling or \\nconstructions projects.  Overall market activity in the commercial real estate \\nsector was mixed in the last month. Leasing remained \\nstrong for retail and industrial properties with rents esca-\\nlating this period. In the office market, vacancy rates and \\nspace available for sublease increased due to compa-\\nnies downsizing. Rental rates in the office segment \\nremained flat; however, landlords were offering more \\ndiscounts and/or concessions to potential credit tenants. \\nIn multifamily, lease rates were starting to flatten out. \\nRespondents stated that tighter credit availability was \\nstarting to negatively impact investments into new pro-\\njects. Commercial contractors noted a continued lack of \\nskilled labor, and also that the amount of work out to bid \\nhas slowed substantially.  \\nBanking and Finance  \\nLoan demand slowed slightly across most loan types, \\nmost notably in the commercial real estate and business \\nloan portfolios. This slowing of demand continued to be \\nattributed to rising interest rates and uncertain economic \\nconditions. Consumer loan demand remained stable, \\nwith home equity loans showing moderate growth. Some \\nbanks reported declines in deposits as customers moved \\nfunds to higher yield products. Institutions also noted a \\nslight degrading of borrower ’s credit quality due to their \\nincreased costs of conducting business. Loan delinquen-\\ncy rates remain stable, but institutions have been closely \\nmonitoring their portfolios.  \\nNonfinancial Services  \\nNonfinancial service providers continued to report that \\ndemand for their services as well as revenues had re-\\nmained stable.

Labor availability and retention im-\\nproved, and wage pressures eased. On balance, nonlabor costs continued to moderate and pricing power was mixed. \\nRetail sales softened for discretionary items, but consumer spending on essentials remained solid. Auto sales were \\nstrong. Domestic leisure travel declined while business and international travel rose; cruise demand was robust. Hous-\\ning demand remained durable; home inventories fell, and house prices rose. Commercial real estate conditions were \\nmixed. Transportation activity slowed. Manufacturing experienced strong demand. Loan volume continued to rise, but \\ndeposit growth slowed. Activity in the energy sector was stable. Agriculture demand slowed.   \\nLabor Markets  \\nThe majority of Sixth District contacts reported that labor \\navailability and retention improved, and most firms con-\\ntinued to hire. However, challenges filling corporate \\nroles, skilled construction, and healthcare positions were \\nnoted while, for some firms, entry -level hourly service \\nroles were easier to fill. A number of manufacturers \\nremained extremely short -staffed and utilized overtime to \\nrun at capacity, while other manufacturing firms reported \\nstabilized employment levels and reduced overtime to \\nalign with softer demand. Among those firms experienc-\\ning weaker demand, most remained reluctant to lay off \\nstaff that they had endeavored to attract and retain, but \\nseveral slowed the pace of hiring except for exceptional \\ncandidates or relied on attrition to shrink their workforce.  \\nOverall, wage growth remained higher than pre -\\npandemic levels. Most contacts reported that wage \\npressures continued to ease, and the majority said the \\npace of increases had begun to moderate, in line with \\nexpectations.    \\nPrices \\nNonlabor costs continued to stabilize over the reporting \\nperiod. However, several Florida contacts noted signifi-\\ncant increases in insurance costs. The cost of food \\nproducts moderated, aided by decreases in freight and \\noverland delivery costs. Construction input costs also \\ndeclined, with commodities like steel and lumber falling \\nto or near pre -pandemic levels. While wholesalers in-\\ncreasingly reported pushback from clients on price in-\\ncreases, consumer prices remained elevated as retailers \\nsaw minimal impact to demand. The Atlanta Fed ’s Busi-\\nness Inflation Expectations survey showed year -over-\\nyear unit cost growth was 3.1 percent, on average, in \\nJune, down significantly from 3.5 percent in May. Firms' year-ahead inflation expectations also decreased in June \\nto 2.7 percent, on average , from 2.9 percent in May.   \\nConsume r Spe nding a nd Tourism \\nRetailers described consumers as more value conscious \\nsince the previous report. Discretionary spending on \\nitems such as clothing, electronics, and recreation ha s \\nmoderated amid a behavior shift to fewer store visits and \\nless impulse buying. However, spending on food and \\nbeverages, househol d essentials and healthc are neces-\\nsities rose. Retailers expect that deman d will stabilize in \\nthe second half of 2023. Automobil e dealers reported \\nthat sales remained resilient, although consumers have \\nbegun to trade down to lower price-point models. \\nTourism and hospitality contacts reported further soften-\\ning demand for domestic leisure travel , while internation-\\nal, group, and business travel strengthene d year over \\nyear. Hotel occupancy across most destination beach \\nresorts fell since the previous report and those hoteliers \\nreported some diminishe d pricing power. Demand for \\ncruise travel and on-board spending remained robust.  \\nConstruction and Rea l Estate \\nHousing demand remained strong throughout the District \\namid declining existing home inventories. Home sales in \\nmany metro areas rose to near seasonal norms, creating \\npersistent supply shortages. Home prices experienced \\nsteady upward pressure on a monthly basis as a result \\nof low supply. Limited existing home inventories drove \\ndemand for new home construction. Though down from \\nlast year, the share of builders offering incentives to \\nattract homebuyers, such as interest ra te buydowns, \\nremained high . Home ownership affordability throughout \\nmost markets in the District worsened as home prices \\nand mortgage rates trended higher.

While modestly decelerating, \\ngeneral retail and industrial activity remained at healthy \\nlevels. The multifamily sector cooled as demand for \\nluxury/higher -priced units deteriorated. While declining \\noverall, office sector conditions were mixed; activity in \\nnewer buildings was solid, while occupancy in older \\nbuildings declined as tenants vacated to newer struc-\\ntures. Additionally, some older buildings have incurred \\nsizeable declines in value. More contacts reported con-\\ncerns regarding financing, as some banks heightened \\nunderwriting standards and reduced funding commit-\\nments. Contacts also noted more uncertainty amid de-\\nclining CRE values.  \\nTransportation  \\nTransportation activity slowed further over the reporting \\nperiod. Ocean carriers and ports reported declines in \\ncontainer traffic, owing to inventory destocking by retail-\\ners and weaker global demand. District railroads report-\\ned significant decreases in year -over-year freight vol-\\numes, including double -digit decreases in intermodal \\nshipments. Logistics firms reported revenues from ware-\\nhousing were flat compared with 2022; higher prices \\nhelped to offset volume declines.  \\nManufacturing  \\nMany manufacturers reported healthy business condi-\\ntions over the reporting period. Some contacts noted a \\nslight decrease in demand, which many characterized as \\na normalization, and most firms reported robust pipelines \\nof orders. While lead times and availability of many \\ninputs have improved, firms noted lingering shortages of \\nsome inputs, particularly electrical switchgears. Auto \\nmanufacturers saw strong demand but noted signs of \\ntrade -downs to less expensive vehicles and expect to \\nsee some slowing in the coming months.   \\nBanking and Finance \\nOn balance, growth slowed at District financial institu-\\ntions, led by a slight decline in the deposit base in recent \\nmonths as interest rate increases continued to encour-\\nage customers to move deposits into higher -yielding \\nalternatives. To help offset slowing deposit growth on a \\nyear-over-year basis, institutions steadily increased \\ninterest rates on deposits. Institutions reported continued \\nloan growth, primarily residential, construction, and \\ndevelopment, which was offset by a decline in securities \\nportfolios. Many of the financial institutions have yet to \\nreport significant increases in delinquencies, though \\nperformance varied widely. Contacts expect asset quality \\nto normalize over the coming quarters.   \\nEnergy \\nContacts reported that most energy segments were flat or up over the reporting period. While oil and gas pro-\\nduction continued, regional output was generally un-\\nchanged. Refiners described high utilization to meet \\nsummer demand for gasoline. Chemical producers noted \\nstrong demand for products that support the renewables \\nsector, which continued to experience considerable \\ngrowth in the manufacturing of batteries, solar cells, \\nturbines, renewable fuels, and more. Utility providers \\nreported commercial segment growth across the District, \\nalthough industrial segment growth was concentrated in \\nregions that experienced gains from commodity produc-\\ntion.    \\nAgriculture  \\nAgricultural conditions were soft over the reporting peri-\\nod. Oversupplies of cheese kept demand for milk low. \\nWith fewer avian flu outbreaks, chicken exports in-\\ncreased somewhat, but overall demand for chicken \\nremained down. Citrus growers experienced good re-\\nturns on sales but weak profits because of low yields. \\nRow crops were generally healthy, although severe \\nstorms damaged crops in some parts of Mississippi and \\nAlabama. Demand for cotton continued to fall. The cattle \\nmarket remained strong as demand for beef remained \\nhigh amid low supply. ■ \\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: \\nwww. frbatlanta.org/economy -matters/regional -economics  ', metadata={'date': '20230712', 'category': 'FED Beige Book', 'author': 'FED'}),\n",

Contacts generally expected a  \\nsmall decline in demand over the  next year and many expressed concerns about the potential for a recession. Employ-\\nment increased moderately; nonbusiness contacts saw little change in activity; consumer spending was flat; business \\nspending and construction and real estate activity declined slightly; and manufacturing decreased modestly. Prices and  \\nwages rose moderately, while financial conditions tightened slightly further. Expectations for farm incomes in 2023 \\ndecreased some.   \\nLabor Markets  \\nEmployment rose moderately in late May and June and \\ncontacts expected a similar rate of increase over the \\nnext 12 months. Many contacts continued to have diffi-\\nculty finding workers, particularly higher skilled labor, \\nthough many also said that hiring had become easier, \\nand several noted they were fully staffed. One program \\nadministrator observed that some manufacturers were \\nmanaging changing labor needs by briefly laying off \\nworkers and then rehiring them, sometimes repeatedly. \\nWage and benefit costs rose moderately. A few contacts \\nnoted wage increases in the 3 to 5 percent range in \\nrecent labor union contract agreements. Some indicated \\nhealthcare costs had risen significantly.  \\nPrices  \\nPrices rose moderately over the reporting period and \\ncontacts expected a similar rate of increase over the \\nnext 12 months. Nonlabor costs were up modestly, with \\nrising raw materials and energy costs contributing to the \\nincrease. Contacts continued to note that growth in \\nshipping costs had slowed noticeably. One contact in \\nfinance reported improved margins for his manufacturing \\nclients, who saw input costs come down but were able to \\nmaintain higher selling prices. Consumer prices general-\\nly increased moderately due to the continued elevated \\nlevel of demand and the passthrough of higher costs.  Consumer Spending  \\nConsumer spending was little changed in late May and \\nJune. Nonauto retail spending was flat overall, with \\ncontacts highlighting increased sales of furniture and \\nlawn and garden products but declining sales at conven-\\nience stores and in the electronics and building materials \\nsegments. Spending further shifted toward essential \\nitems and away from discretionary ones, and for many \\nproducts, consumers continued to trade down in quality \\nor convenience. Light vehicle sales were unchanged but \\nat a higher level than had been expected earlier in the \\nyear. Leisure and hospitality spending was also flat but \\nat a strong level, with contacts reporting a small increase \\nin spending at amusement parks and tourist attractions \\nbut less air travel.

Auto inventories rose slightly but re-\\nmained below pre -pandemic levels, with contacts noting \\nthat railcar shortages were slowing deliveries of vehicles \\nto dealers. In manufacturing, inventories increased mod-\\nestly, and contacts said that supply chain issues, while \\nstill arising at times, had returned to pre -pandemic \\nnorms.  \\nConstruction and Real Estate  \\nConstruction and real estate activity decreased slightly \\nover the reporting period. Residential construction ticked \\ndown, reflecting a slowdown in single -family develop-\\nment. New home sales decreased slightly, while new \\nhome prices increased slightly. Residential real estate \\nactivity was little changed. An Iowa contact said that \\ncash transactions continued to be a larger proportion of \\nsales than they have been historically as high interest \\nrates were pushing borrowers out of the market. Existing \\nhome prices were down some, while rents were flat. \\nNonresidential construction activity slowed overall as \\nhigh interest rates, elevated cost pressures, and shortag-\\nes of key inputs such as electrical components weighed \\non activity. Nonresidential construction prices remained \\nat elevated levels. Commercial real estate activity de-\\ncreased modestly. Prices decreased slightly, rents fell \\nmodestly, and vacancy rates were up slightly.  \\nManufacturing  \\nManufacturing demand decreased modestly in late May \\nand June and backlogs were down moderately. Steel \\norders were up slightly, supported by solid demand from \\nthe auto and construction industries. Fabricated metals \\norders decreased slightly, in part due to weaker demand \\nin the aerospace sector. Machinery sales also decreased \\nslightly, with contacts highlighting less demand from the \\nauto industry. In contrast, auto industry contacts said \\nproduction was steady on balance. Heavy truck orders \\nincreased slightly amidst very low inventories.  \\nBanking and Finance  \\nFinancial conditions tightened slightly further on balance \\nduring the reporting period. Bond and equity market \\nvalues edged up, while volatility edged down. Business \\nloan demand decreased modestly, as borrowing rates \\nrose and standards tightened some. One contact said \\nweak demand was concentrated among clients in the \\nconsumer discretionary, durable goods, and retail sec-\\ntors, which were seeing slowing sales. Business loan \\nquality deteriorated a bit. Consumer loan demand de-\\ncreased slightly overall, but several contacts noted great-\\ner credit card usage. Consumer loan quality decreased \\nslightly, while borrowing rates rose modestly and lending \\nstandards were somewhat tighter.  Agriculture  \\nExpectations for Seventh District farm incomes for 2023 \\ndeteriorated some as drought expanded throughout the \\nDistrict. One contact said, “It is time to be concerned, but \\ntoo soon to panic. ” Crops were behind normal growing \\nprogress. Expectations for this year ’s corn crop wors-\\nened more than for soybeans because corn is more \\nsensitive to drought at this growth stage. Crop prices \\nwere volatile during the reporting period; while corn \\nprices ended down, soybean prices were up, and wheat \\nprices were about the same. Some input costs were \\nlower. Prices for milk were down once again, extending \\nlosses for dairy farms. Although hog prices moved up \\nsome, producers continued to struggle to turn a profit. \\nEgg prices edged up. Cattle prices made further gains, \\nas drought limited water and forage availability, forcing \\nfarmers to trim their herd sizes.  \\nCommunity Conditions  \\nCommunity, nonprofit, and small business support con-\\ntacts reported little change in activity, which was at a \\nrobust level. That said, there were signs the economy \\nwas cooling. State government officials saw slowing \\ngrowth in tax revenues and a small increase in demand \\nfor unemployment insurance. High interest rates were \\nchallenging Community Development Finance Institu-\\ntions ’ efforts to lend at affordable rates to low - and mod-\\nerate -income borrowers, including small businesses and \\nprospective homeowners. Contacts offering small busi-\\nness services, in particular to small manufacturers, re-\\nported that a lack of workers remained an important \\nissue and was holding back production. At the same \\ntime, contacts engaged with low wage workers stressed \\nthat wages were too low to meet daily needs in the face \\nof rising costs, particularly for housing. ■ \\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit:  \\nchicagofed.org/cfsec  ', metadata={'date': '20230712', 'category': 'FED Beige Book', 'author': 'FED'}),\n",

Although employers reported better employ-\\nee retention, they continued to have difficulties finding workers, especially skilled ones. Wage pressures lessened slight-\\nly. Consumer spending was largely steady, though contacts reported a shift away from discretionary goods and declin-\\ning demand for big -ticket purchases that require financing. The residential real estate sector saw activity increase, but \\nthe commercial real estate sector reported worsening conditions at non -premium office and retail spaces. Banking con-\\ntacts reported moderate declines in loan demand and compressed net interest margins.

The overall \\noutlook remains pessimistic but has improved slightly.  \\nLabor Markets  \\nEmployment has remained unchanged since our previ-\\nous report. Employers continue to report tight labor \\nmarkets. Unemployment rates remain low and hiring \\nworkers has remained a burden for several industries. \\nMany contacts have reported using technology improve-\\nments to deal with labor shortages. A healthcare contact \\nin Little Rock reported they have begun to examine how \\nAI can help with paperwork to offset persistent labor \\nshortages. A Louisville transportation contact noted that \\nwhile companies are still competing for workers, there is \\nless job switching than in previous months. A northwest \\nArkansas food service company reported receiving \\nunsolicited resumes which hadn ’t happened in “quite \\nsome time. ” \\nWages have grown slightly since our previous report. \\nMost contacts across the region reported either slight or \\nno wage increases. Retail contacts in Little Rock have \\nreported increasing their minimum wages in the past \\nmonth to help fill labor shortages. A workforce contact \\nnoted that wage growth is still strong in construction \\ntrades due to high demand and a shortage of skilled \\nworkers.  Prices \\nPrices have increased modestly since our previous \\nreport. Although respondents ’ plans for future price \\nincreases varied, two comments were consistent. First, \\nnearly all respondents reported higher labor costs. Sec-\\nond, many contacts reported an inability to fully pass on \\nincreased costs to consumers, which has compressed \\nmargins. A contact in the grocery industry reported that \\nthey would pass about 25 -33% of higher costs to con-\\nsumers. The same contact reported decreasing consum-\\ner demand and increasing consumer price sensitivity. A \\ncontact in the car industry plans to increase prices, but at \\na slower rate than before in order to maintain competi-\\ntion in the market. Other contacts reported little to no \\nincrease in non -labor cost pressures. A contact in the \\nfurniture industry reported that prices may decrease in \\nthe future after recouping previous losses from excess \\nfreight costs.  \\nConsumer Spending  \\nDistrict general retailers, auto dealers, and hospitality \\ncontacts reported mixed business activity and a slightly \\nnegative outlook.

A \\nLittle Rock auto dealer reported that business activity \\nwas down slightly as bank financing continues to tighten. \\nAn Arkansas contact reported that sales of high -end \\nboats are steady and low -end boats are down slightly, \\nbut sales for middle -market boats have collapsed. Res-\\ntaurants in Memphis expressed concern that crime might \\nlead to faltering consumer demand.  District hospitality \\ncontacts noted mixed business activity over the past \\nmonth but expect to have a typical busy summer.   \\nManufacturing  \\nManufacturing activity has increased slightly since our \\nprevious report. Firms in Missouri and Arkansas have \\nreported slight upticks in new orders and production. \\nCongestion with supply chains and transportation contin-\\nues to ease, while production schedules also remain \\nsteady. A new glass bottle manufacturing facility broke \\nground in Bowling Green, Kentucky, creating 140 new \\njobs and a capital investment of $240 million. Two furni-\\nture manufacturers in Lee County, Tennessee, added \\n130 new employees, with an increased payroll of $4.5 \\nmillion. Firms remain optimistic that demand will remain \\nconsistent at least in the near term.  \\nNonfinancial Services  \\nConditions in the nonfinancial services sector have been \\nlargely unchanged since our previous report. Air traffic \\nrose slightly across the District. Contacts reported that \\nlabor shortages have constrained public transit in St. \\nLouis, leading workers to look for alternative transporta-\\ntion options. A Louisville contact reported continually \\nimproving conditions in the transportation sector. Little \\nRock contacts reported that rising healthcare costs and \\nlabor shortages have put a strain on the industry. The \\nLittle Rock bicycling industry has seen significant growth \\nin recent quarters, generating more than $150 million in \\ntotal economic impact from jobs to tourism to taxes. A St. \\nLouis workforce contact reported an increase in informal \\nchildcare providers offering small -scale services.  \\nReal Estate and Construction  \\nResidential real estate has seen slightly increased activi-\\nty since our previous report. Median sale prices for resi-\\ndential real estate in the Little Rock, Louisville, and \\nMemphis MSAs rose slightly in May, while median sale \\nprices remained unchanged in the St. Louis MSA. Inven-\\ntory dropped slightly in the Little Rock, Louisville, and \\nMemphis MSAs in the past month. In the Louisville and \\nMemphis MSAs, pending sales have jumped by 20% \\nsince our previous report. In the four major District \\nMSAs, rental rates for residential real estate have seen \\nsmall increases since our previous report. A northwest Arkansas contact noted that home price growth has \\ndecelerated in recent weeks.  \\nMemphis -area real estate and construction contacts \\nreported spillover effects from a major EV manufacturing \\nproject. Public construction elsewhere in the District has \\nremained busy since our previous report, while private \\nprojects are starting to press pause for the moment. A \\nLouisville commercial construction contact reported \\nhaving 12 -18 months of existing projects to complete but \\nthat some are aging out or being put on hold due to \\nincreased costs. A Louisville commercial real estate \\ncontact reported a trend of tenants moving from class “B” \\noffice spaces to class “A” spaces at reduced rates and \\nnoted that this shows no signs of slowing down in the \\nfuture.  \\nBanking and Finance  \\nBanking conditions in the District have remained stable \\nsince our previous report, even as lending activity contin-\\nues to soften. Year -over-year loan volume declined \\nmoderately. Contacts reported that small business lend-\\ning in particular has been slow, due to higher interest \\nrates. Total deposits growth, on the other hand, has \\nseen a strong increase since the past quarter. Rising \\ndeposit interest rates continue to create a very competi-\\ntive market for deposits, which is compressing net inter-\\nest margins. Customer concerns regarding deposit safe-\\nty remain relatively low in the aftermath of the Silicon \\nValley Bank and Signature Bank failures. Although delin-\\nquency rates have continued to rise toward pre -\\npandemic levels, contacts maintain a positive near -term \\noutlook on credit quality. A retailer reported that credit \\ncard usage has risen sharply over the past few months, \\nbringing credit utilization to its highest levels since 2019.  \\nAgriculture and Natural Resources  \\nDistrict agriculture conditions declined moderately rela-\\ntive to the previous reporting period. Between the end of \\nMay and end of June, the percentages of corn, cotton, \\nrice, and soybeans rated fair or better saw slight to mod-\\nerate decreases across the board. Compared with this \\ntime last year, overall crop conditions have declined \\nmoderately. Crop conditions both began lower and de-\\ncreased more over the period when compared with this \\ntime last year. With the exception of cotton, which in-\\ncreased modestly, all other individual crop conditions \\nwere worse compared with last year. Contacts in the \\nLittle Rock region reported some anxiety about the expir-\\ning farm bill later this year. While commodity prices \\nremain high generally, some have begun retreating while \\ninput and fuel costs remain high, leading to profitability \\nconcerns as we enter the second half of the year. ■ ', metadata={'date': '20230712', 'category': 'FED Beige Book', 'author': 'FED'}),\n",

Although hiring remained flat generally, expected employment levels at most businesses continued to point down-\\nward. Businesses predominantly reported relying on natural turnover and attrition to reduce their headcounts, rather than \\nlayoffs. Consumer spending rose, but at a more moderate pace after surging in recent months. Homeowners in several \\nDistrict states indicated that recent changes to tax assessments of their homes increased their monthly housing expens-\\nes, which could persistently impair their ability to spend on more discretionary items. Concerns about the adverse effects \\nof higher financing costs on credit quality were pervasive, spanning consumer segments, commercial real estate, and \\nsmall businesses. Energy activity in the District decreased significantly as weak oil and gas prices continued to squeeze \\nprofitability. Oil and gas contacts noted that capital expenditures are down from this time last year and further declines ar e \\nexpected, despite steady access to credit. Expectations that dry conditions will reduce crop yields pushed several com-\\nmodity prices higher, but contacts noted that lower production could still limit revenues for many producers.   \\nLabor Markets  \\nLabor conditions remained mostly unchanged in the \\nTenth District during June, with noticeable differences \\nacross sectors. Manufacturing contacts reported modest \\ndeclines in employment amid slowing orders and weak-\\nening demand. In contrast, services contacts reported a \\nslight increase in hiring driven by steady consumer \\nspending. Despite the more sluggish pace of hiring \\nrecently, wages continued to grow moderately driven \\nlargely by still -tight labor conditions for services firms.  \\nAlthough the level of hiring was mostly unchanged, \\nexpectations for job growth and labor utilization over the \\nnext 6 months continued to soften. In fact, contacts \\ngenerally expected a slight decline in their employment \\nlevels over the coming months and are reportedly al-\\nready reducing hours worked. When asked, the over-\\nwhelming majority of contacts indicated they are not yet \\nplanning to layoff workers to reach a lower headcount. \\nInstead, they indicated plans to post fewer positions and \\npause hiring activity in lieu of laying off employees. For \\nexample, one contact expressed that “pausing hiring \\nnow and relying on attrition helps to avoid harder deci-\\nsions later. ”  Prices \\nThe pace of price growth was mixed across the regional \\neconomy. Manufacturing contacts reported prices grew \\nat a slight pace, continuing to moderate from historically \\nhigh growth. Most non -durable manufacturers even \\nreported declines in prices for finished products. But \\nservices businesses reported steady price growth at a \\nmoderate pace for inputs and selling prices, and some \\nexpansion of profit margins. Particularly, retail trade and \\nleisure and hospitality businesses demonstrated im-\\nproved ability to pass price increases to customers. Most \\nbusinesses expected prices to continue to increase \\nmoderately over the next six months.      \\nConsumer Spending  \\nFollowing a surge in spending in recent months, the \\npace of spending growth slowed to a moderate pace in \\nJune. Contacts at restaurants and retail establishments \\nreported ongoing strength, but consumers were report-\\nedly much more sensitive to hotel rates in recent weeks. \\nSeveral contacts noted a pickup in business travel during \\nthe weekdays partially offset the moderate decline in \\nweekend hotel stays by leisure travelers, and that occu-\\npancy declined last month after rising steadily for over a \\nyear. Auto purchases remained subdued in most District \\nstates. The Beige Book ■ June 2023  ', metadata={'date': '20230712', 'category': 'FED Beige Book', 'author': 'FED'}),\n",

Contacts reported recent financial \\nchallenges caused them to increasingly access non -\\ntraditional forms of credit with higher interest rates, such \\nas credit cards and online lending platforms. Moreover, a \\ngrowing number of businesses reported paying only their \\nminimum credit card payment, or missing payments \\ncompletely, which has negatively impacted their credit \\nreports. While distressed financial conditions limited \\naccess to loans from traditional lenders, community \\ndevelopment financial institutions reported strength in \\nthe ability to provide loans with rates below 10% for \\nqualified borrowers.    \\nManufacturing and Other Business Activity \\nManufacturing activity declined at a moderate pace, but \\nservice contacts reported a moderate increase in activity. \\nManufacturing contacts reported broad based declines, \\nincluding reduced order demand and shorter order back-\\nlogs. Furthermore, manufacturing contacts expect busi-\\nness conditions will soften in coming months, noting \\ncontinued weakening in order back logs and a further \\ndeterioration in demand. Despite softening in business \\nconditions for manufacturing firms, business contacts \\nexpressed a continued willingness invest through capital \\nimprovement projects, albeit at a much slower pace than \\na year ago. Service contacts generally indicated much \\nhealthier business conditions with a moderate expansion \\nin the demand for their services. Despite current favora-\\nble business conditions, service contacts expect a sof-\\ntening in activity in the coming months driven by expec-\\ntations for weaking demand. Contacts in advertising and \\nmarketing were an exception, already feeling a stark \\npullback in customer demand. Moreover, advertising \\ncontacts indicated the onset of AI was accelerating the \\ndeclines in demand for out -of-house service providers.  \\nReal Estate and Construction \\nSeveral home builders indicated activity picked up over \\nthe past couple of months. Construction was supported \\nboth by promotional deals offered by builders that miti-\\ngated the effects of higher mortgage rates and by a \\nstabilization in the costs of building materials. Some \\ncontacts suggested that slowing commercial real estate \\nconstruction could further boost growth in the supply of \\nhousing over coming months because workers may be \\nmore available and materials prices somewhat lower. \\nHomeowners in several District states indicated recent \\nchanges to tax assessments of their homes increased \\nmonthly expenses, which may persistently impair their \\nspending power.  Community and Regional Banking  \\nContacts ’ views on loan demand were mixed across the \\nDistrict last month, but concerns about the effects of \\nrising credit costs, particularly on consumer loan types, \\nwere ubiquitous. Contacts also noted concerns for com-\\nmercial real estate (CRE) credit quality, particularly \\ncredits backed by office properties, and expected credit \\nquality to worsen across all loan types over the next six \\nmonths. Credit standards remained unchanged, though \\nsome respondents highlighted reduced risk appetite for \\nCRE deals. Deposit balances declined in June as cus-\\ntomers moved to competitors offering higher yields or \\ninvested in U.S. Treasuries after the resolution of the \\ndebt ceiling. Deposit insurance coverage and the desire \\nfor diversification also drove movement of large custom-\\ner balances and contributed to continued tightening in \\nbanking system liquidity.    \\nEnergy \\nTenth District energy activity declined moderately last \\nmonth. The number of active rigs decreased significantly \\nas weak oil and gas prices continued to squeeze profita-\\nbility. District firms reported a substantial decline in reve-\\nnues, profits, and supplier delivery times since the last \\nreport. Profits and supplier delivery times are expected \\nto continue declining over the next six months. Accord-\\ningly, District firms anticipate further reduction in activity \\nin the near term. The average price needed for a sub-\\nstantial increase in drilling to occur remains above long -\\nterm price expectations for oil and gas, indicating that \\nfuture production growth may be constrained for a while. \\nContacts noted that capital expenditures are down from \\nthis time last year and further declines were expected, \\ndespite steady access to credit.      \\nAgriculture  \\nAgricultural economic conditions in the Tenth District \\nwere steady through June. The price of most major \\ncommodities increased moderately from the previous \\nmonth as drought intensified in many major crop produc-\\ntion areas across the nation. Expectations for dry condi-\\ntions to reduce yields pushed prices higher, but lower \\nproduction could limit revenues for some producers. \\nThrough mid -June, an average of about 15% of corn and \\nsoybean acres and nearly 30% of winter wheat acres \\nwere in poor or very poor condition across all District \\nstates. Dry weather also continued to limit grass and \\nfeed supplies, resulting in higher costs for many cattle \\nproducers. Despite concerns about the potential for \\nreduced profitability ahead, agricultural lenders contin-\\nued to report strong credit conditions. ■ \\nFor more information about District economic conditions visit: \\nwww.KansasCityFed.org/research/regional -research ', metadata={'date': '20230712', 'category': 'FED Beige Book', 'author': 'FED'}),\n",

Hiring slowed to a crawl in manufacturing, while service sector firms added to payrolls at an average pace. While \\noilfield services firms were  still hiring and noted signifi-\\ncant challenges in recruiting  workers, more layoffs were \\nseen in natural gas regions due to weak outlooks. Scat-\\ntered reports of layoffs also  came from transportation \\nservices and manufacturing. Recruitment remained a \\nchallenge for several firms. Reports of labor supply \\nconstraints continued in the health care sector and there were mentions of worker shortages in some other sec-\\ntors as well, including transportation and retail. In a June \\nDallas Fed survey of more  than 350 executives, 44 \\npercent of firms noted being understaffed and looking to \\nhire while 12 percent said they were opting not to hire despite being shorthanded.   \\nWage pressures were little changed, remaining elevated. \\nHigher labor costs continued to be a primary concern for \\nmany firms including nonprofits, though there were some \\nmentions of easing in IT wages. \\nPrices \\nPrice pressures were mixed; still elevated in the service sector but fully subsided in manufacturing.

Revenue growth was led by \\ntransportation and warehousing services followed by \\nmiscellaneous service and pr ofessional, scientific, and \\ntechnical service firms. Healthcare revenues declined, and demand for health services, though improving, re-\\nmained below pre-pandemic levels. Accommodation and food services firms said revenues continued to weaken \\nwhich they attributed to a slowdown in leisure spending \\nstemming from economic uncertainty. Staffing firms \\nnoted mixed demand, with flat activity in manufacturing \\nbut persistent strong placement s of white-collar workers \\nin the service sector, particularly healthcare. Airlines \\ncontinued to report strong demand, mostly for leisure \\ntravel. Business travel activity remained uneven, with \\nsolid demand from the public sector but declining activity \\nfrom the technology and energy industries. Overall out-looks were flat, but several contacts said that heightened \\nbusiness uncertainty had put buying decisions and pro-\\njects on hold. \\nConstruction and Real Estate \\nHousing demand rose during the reporting period. Exist-ing-home sales increased, and builders noted solid \\ndemand, particularly of quick move-in or inventory \\nhomes, as buyers were hesitant to deal with the uncer-\\ntainty surrounding mortgage rates. Dallas–Fort Worth \\nand Houston were characterized as the strongest mar-kets. Incentives such as rate buydowns remained in \\nplace, and prices were largely stable, though there were \\nreports of increases in se lected areas. Construction \\ncycle times have improved, though a shortage of trans-formers was dampening completions. Builders have reaccumulated their backlogs of build-to-suit homes, and \\nhousing starts are expected to increase in the second \\nhalf of the year. Outlooks remained cautious, and con-\\ntacts noted tighter lending for construction and develop-\\nment loans.  \\nActivity in commercial real estate was little changed \\nsince the last report. Apartment rents were flat to up, and \\nleasing activity picked up moderately. Office markets \\ncontinued to face headwinds, while industrial markets \\ngenerally remained solid. Investment sales activity stayed subdued, and contacts said banks were raising \\nthe loan-to-value ratios on loans. Outlooks were mixed. \\nFinancial Services \\nLoan demand declined for the seventh period in a row, \\nand most bankers expect a further deterioration over the next six months. Overall loan volumes continued to fall, \\nwith particular weakness seen in consumer lending. \\nWhile commercial real estate and commercial and indus-\\ntrial loan volumes continued to see marked volume \\ndeclines, residential real estate lending remained stable. Loan nonperformance increased, with the rise led by commercial real estate loans. Credit standards and \\nterms continued to tighten, and loan pricing continued to \\nrise. Bankers’ outlooks remained pessimistic, with con-\\ntacts expecting a further contraction in business activity \\nand an increase in nonperforming loans over the next six months. \\nEnergy \\nDrilling activity for oil and gas wells declined over the \\npast six weeks. The Eleventh District rig count fell mod-\\nerately as lower prices for crude and natural gas made some projects uneconomical. Well completions were \\nholding up better than drilling activity. Most contacts \\nreported that tighter credit conditions since February \\nhave had slight to no impact on their firms, though a few \\nindependent producers said it had considerably reduced their ability to invest in new projects. Outlooks varied. \\nThe industry is still largel y expected to increase oil-\\ndirected drilling and completion activities modestly through year end, while prospects on the natural gas \\nside remained weak due to subdued prices.  \\nAgriculture \\nDrought conditions eased substantially over the past six weeks, with now less than a quarter of the district in \\ndrought. Increased soil moisture broadly improved crop \\nand pasture conditions, though heavy rains caused \\nsignificant disruption to cotton planting in the Texas High \\nPlains. A sizeable portion of cotton acreage in that area may not be harvestable this year, either because of \\nprevented planting or crop flooding. Row crop prices \\ngenerally moved up over the reporting period, and cattle \\nprices increased dramatica lly, driven by steady demand \\nfor meat but reduced supplies of both cattle and beef.   \\nCommunity Perspectives \\nNonprofits noted increased demand for their services. \\nHousing instability and affordability remained a top con-\\ncern, and several contacts said that inflation and gentrifi-\\ncation of neighborhoods has made housing costs, includ-ing property taxes, unaffordable for low to moderate \\nincome households. As a result, some are doubling up \\nand living with other families in the same home. Fund-\\nraising was a challenge for some nonprofits, and a con-\\ntact noted that the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds were running low. A nonprofit said age restrictions \\non certain program funding was making it challenging to \\nprovide services to other age groups.

Layoffs continued, albeit at a slower pace, in the \\nfinancial services and technology sectors. Staffing levels \\nin other sectors were generally steady, but employers \\nadjusted their future hiring plans in response to overall \\neconomic uncertainty. Employers facing moderating \\ndemand favored reducing staff hours over layoffs.  \\nWage growth slowed notably across several sectors. \\nImproved labor availability led to wage increases closer \\nin line with historical rates, particularly for entry -level \\npositions, in construction, manufacturing, retail, financial \\nservices, and technology. In contrast, contacts continued \\nto report paying above -average salaries for experienced \\nand skilled workers in consumer and business services. \\nIn addition to higher pay, some employers offered ex-\\npanded benefits, training, and advancement opportuni-\\nties to attract and retain workers.    \\nPrices \\nPrice increases persisted at a steady pace relative to the \\nlast reporting period. Reports noted elevated inflation \\nacross several industries and products, including utilities, insurance, used vehicles, health care, pet care, and \\nsome construction materials, such as aluminum, con-\\ncrete, and electrical equipment. However, prices of some \\ngoods and services were reportedly stable or down in \\nrecent weeks, including those for gasoline, fabricated \\nmaterials, and banking services.

Production activity in the entertainment and \\nmedia industries remained strained by ongoing collective \\nagreement negotiations between the writers ’ unions and \\nmajor studios. Additionally, art galleries and institutions \\nreported facing significant headwinds due to smaller \\naudiences and declining donations.  \\nManufacturing  \\nManufacturing activity weakened slightly but remained \\nsolid overall. New manufacturing orders for apparel, \\nelectronics, and furniture softened, while demand for \\ncapital equipment, aerospace, and wood products \\nstrengthened. Conditions in metal production and the \\nrecycling industry remained largely unchanged. Capacity \\nutilization inched down, consistent with overall lower \\ndemand. Shipping and some input costs decreased over \\nthe past few weeks as supply chains and availability of \\nraw materials continued to improve.  \\nAgriculture and Resource -Related Industries \\nConditions in agriculture and resource -related sectors \\nwere mixed. Expanded ocean freight capacity and lower \\nshipping costs supported exports, but lingering backlogs, \\nthe war in Ukraine, and a strong dollar limited access to \\nsome international markets. Domestic retail demand for \\nagricultural products softened and demand from the food \\nservices sector plateaued. Demand for timber rose. \\nProduce yields across the District were broadly up, re-\\ncovering from the wet winter and spring. However, inven-\\ntories of some foods such as raisins and nuts declined. \\nMajor seafood stocks edged up. Rising labor and insur-\\nance costs put upward pressure on production expens-\\nes, while past rains somewhat offset irrigation costs. One \\ncontact noted that ongoing capital investments helped \\nboost productivity and curtail labor costs in the agricul-\\nture sector.  Real Estate and Construction  \\nResidential real estate activity was mixed in recent \\nweeks. Demand for single -family homes was reportedly \\nstrong, but low inventories and high mortgage rates \\nlimited sales. Demand for multifamily housing remained \\nsolid, though a contact in Southern California noted that \\nit has recently taken longer to rent out apartments. Rent-\\nal rates edged up. Contacts across the district reported a \\nslowdown in new construction, particularly for single -\\nfamily homes, citing uncertainty over the economic out-\\nlook and high financing costs. The availability of materi-\\nals continued to improve somewhat, though shortages \\npersisted.  \\nActivity in the commercial real estate market was down \\non balance. Limited credit availability reduced demand \\nfor commercial space and curtailed construction slightly. \\nHowever, contacts in Utah reported strong construction \\nactivity for industrial and retail spaces. Rental rates for \\nindustrial space reportedly plateaued, largely due to \\nweaker demand amid ongoing economic uncertainty, \\nwhile rents for retail space edged up. The office sector \\nremained weak. One Northern California contact noted \\nthat muted brick -and-mortar sales, high operating costs, \\nand safety concerns limited leasing demand for down-\\ntown office space. \\nFinancial Institutions \\nConditions in the financial sector remained generally \\nunchanged over the reporting period. Loan demand was \\nlargely stable but some contacts at regional institutions \\nreported slower loan origination in recent weeks, espe-\\ncially those focused on the residential and commercial \\nreal estate markets. Banks have reportedly faced less \\nvariance in deposit flows compared to the previous re-\\nporting period despite strong competition for deposits. \\nLending standards tightened, and credit quality remained \\nstrong despite some observed increase in delinquency \\nrates.

Labor \\nmarket conditions were strong, with ongoing modest employment gains and steady wage growth. Inflationary pressures \\neased as both input and selling price increases slowed noticeably. Supply availability continued to improve, particularly \\nfor manufacturers, and manufacturing activity edged slightly higher. Consumer spending grew steadily and tourism in \\nNew York City remained strong. While housing markets were solid, exceptionally low inventory remained a challenge \\nand there were some signs of a pullback in demand in parts of the District. Commercial real estate markets remained \\nmostly unchanged, with persistently high office vacancies. Conditions in the broad finance sector continued to deterio-\\nrate, though at a more subdued pace than in recent months.

Looking ahead, businesses expect economic conditions to im-\\nprove, though optimism remained muted.  \\nLabor Markets \\nLabor market conditions were strong, with several con-\\ntacts pointing to some firming in recent weeks. On bal-\\nance, employment increased modestly, though there \\nwere stronger gains reported by personal service provid-\\ners and wholesalers. While firms in the construction \\nsector reportedly shed workers, layoffs generally re-\\nmained concentrated in large firms outside of the region. \\nA contact from the Adirondacks reported that J -1 visa \\nseasonal workers have arrived following a pandemic \\npause, providing a much -needed seasonal boost to the \\nstrained workforce as the tourism season gets into full \\nswing.

       "' Economic activity in the Second District stabilized in recent weeks following a period of moderate weakness. Labor market conditions were strong, with ongoing modest employment gains and steady wage growth. Inflationary pressures eased as both input and selling price increases slowed noticeably. Supply availability continued to improve, particularly for manufacturers, and manufacturing activity edged slightly higher. Consumer spending grew steadily and tourism in New York City remained strong. While housing markets were solid, exceptionally low inventory remained a challenge and there were some signs of a pullback in demand in parts of the District. Commercial real estate markets remained mostly unchanged, with persistently high office vacancies. Conditions in the broad finance sector continued to deteriorate, though at a more subdued pace than in recent months. Regional banks reported ongoing declines in loan demand, tighter credit conditions, and narrowing loan spreads. Looking ahead, businesses expect economic conditions to improve, though optimism remained muted.'"
